1
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,310
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》 前情提要
ATHENA: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,900
我叫李・阿达玛
My name is Lee Adama,

3
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,650
我爱卡拉・瑟瑞丝!
and I love Kara Thrace!

4
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,610
你听到消息了吗?  我们结婚了!你能相信吗?
Did you hear the news? We got married, can you believe it?

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,370
不
No.

6
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,950
不  我不相信
No, I can't believe it.

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,910
祝贺你  山姆  祝好运  你会用得着的
Congratulations, Sam, and good luck. You're gonna need it.

8
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,300
我想你    我也想你啊
I missed you. I missed you, too.

9
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,470
不惜一切代价保护那孩子的生命
GAETA: The child's life must be protected at all costs.

10
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,680
第一个人类与赛昂人的混血儿 这真是个上帝的奇迹
The first Cylon-human hybrid. It truly is a miracle from God.

11
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,350
这孩子不会交给赛昂人来抚养
This child will not be raised by the Cylon,

12
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,180
我不会让赛昂人间在这个事情上沾边的
and we cannot risk Cylon agents getting their hands on it.

13
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,850
这我已经决定了
I've made my decision.

14
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,230
我们失去她了
We lost her.

15
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,360
我们尽力了  但她还是死了 就这样结束了
We did the best we could, but she's dead and that's all there is to it.

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,030
直到赛昂人相信  这孩子已经不存在
ROSLIN: As far as the Cylons know, this child no longer exists.

17
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,160
那就好了  就行了
That is a good, good thing.

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,830
是赫拉
It's Hera.

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,330
上帝的第一个新子民
The first of God's new generation.

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,630
你看到其余五名赛昂人的脸了吗?
Have you seen the faces of the other five Cylons?

21
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,380
没人见过他们吗?
The ones that no one has seen?

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,670
你为什么对他们感兴趣?  我可能是个赛昂人
Why do you want to know about them? I could be a Cylon.

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,720
我以为我们的食物供应是取之不竭的
KAT: I thought our food supply was inexhaustible.

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,800
食物生产系统已经被污染
The food manufacturing system's been contaminated.

25
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,050
我们只能这样了  直到雅典娜回来
If we just hold on until Athena gets back,

26
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,220
这海藻能保证我们活着
this algae can keep us alive indefinitely.

27
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,520
有一条路穿过那个星团 我找到了那个星球
There's a way through the star cluster, and I found the planet.

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,610
正如我们所预计的  这里有一大片海藻
There's huge swathes of algae, just like we thought.

29
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,550
这边有更多的
WOMAN 1: There's some more over here.

30
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,260
好 我只要再…     大概45米…
MAN 1: All right, I'll just have one... MAN 2: About 45 meters...

31
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,850
14英尺的宽度  真的不错
Fourteen inch intake. Yeah, that's great.

32
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,060
把它们装上去摞在一起
MAN 1: Just pack them and stack them,

33
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,230
对  放那边
and put them along this back wall. Right there.

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,610
我得到了你的光线数据    好的 把那些…
MAN 3: I got your meter readings for the light. MAN 4: All right. Get those in...

35
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,610
这些可以装上第一艘猛禽 那些装在第二艘猛禽里
All this can go in the first Raptor, all that can go in the second one.

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,080
需要帮忙吗?  噢  好啊
Need a hand? Yeah.

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,500
再过几天就好了 然后离开这个恶臭的地方
Well, in a couple more days, we can wrap this up, get away from this stench.

38
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,380
其实飞船里和这里差不多一样臭
It stinks as bad up here as it does down there.

39
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,090
至少它吃上去和闻上去味道差不多  是啊
At least it tastes as good as it smells. Yeah.

40
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,506
呵呵  这可是我们的早、午、晚饭 
Well, it's breakfast, lunch and dinner until

41
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:02,430
直到有人找到一个梦想中的星球
 someone finds a hot fudge planet.

42
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,260
看  那是什么?
Now what is this?

43
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,100
那他妈的到底是谁?
Who the hell is that?

44
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,860
星芭  我猜是她
It's Starbuck, I guess.

45
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,400
这个礼拜的第三次了
Third time this week.

46
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,030
真不可思意能以机头向上的姿势降落
It's amazing how she keeps landing on the top of the pilot rotation.

47
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,290
噢  别又围在一起掷硬币
Oh, donut runs are assigned off a coin flip.

48
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,960
卡拉可能觉得她遇到了一连串的坏运气
Kara probably thinks she's running a stream of bad luck.

49
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,460
我想我应该过去一下
You know, I should probably get over there.

50
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,300
我想逃掉例会去歇一歇 如果你不介意的话
I'm gonna skip the meet and greet this time if you don't mind.

51
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,800
当然不介意
Sure.

52
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,150
你不觉得把飞机降落得太"爽"了吗?
You brought her in a little hot, don't you think?

53
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,780
是啊  我知道  我在被打分
Yeah, well, had I known I was being graded,

54
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,240
我完成了几个滚筒动作
I would have thrown in a couple barrel rolls.

55
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,170
别忘了提醒我谢谢CAG
Remind me to thank the CAG

56
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,340
要不然就轮不到我来地面了
for sticking me on these crap donut runs, huh?

57
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,260
太不可思议了  你知道吗?
This is insane, you know.

58
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,350
哈
Uh-huh.

59
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,100
这正是我喜欢的方式
That's just the way I like it.

60
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,350
我们要不要开始清空这些帐篷?
Should we start emptying the tents?

61
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,980
嗯  先把这里清理干净然后再弄帐篷
Yeah. Get this cleared up first, and then get to the tents.

62
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,230
好的
Okay.

63
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,740
这儿
Here.

64
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,820
好
Good.

65
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,130
我都不敢正眼看小杜
I can barely look Dee in the eye.

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,170
我们得想想办法
We've got to do something about this.

67
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,840
好啊  比如说?
Okay, like what?

68
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,300
我不知道  
I don't know.

69
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,930
离婚怎么样?
Like divorce.

70
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,140
哦   嗯
Uh-uh. Mmm-mmm.

71
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,140
啊  拜托  让我们面对现实吧
Oh, come on, let's get real here.

72
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,730
是你自己说事情很糟糕
You said yourself, things were bad.

73
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,690
你的婚姻已经名存实亡了
Your marriage is failing.

74
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,820
不错  不过婚姻是神圣的
Yeah, but marriage is a sacrament.

75
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,570
那不是金字塔游戏  你不能...
It's not a Pyramid game. You don't...

76
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,860
你不能亵渎神圣的 李
You don't get do-overs, Lee.

77
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,000
我已经在上帝面前发过誓了
I made a vow in the sight of the Gods

78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,960
我不会违背我的诺言
and I'm not gonna break that.

79
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,250
每一次我们这样干的时候 你都在违背那个诺言
You're breaking it every time we do this.

80
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,130
每一次都是
Every time.

81
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,090
话不能这么说的
Divorce is different.

82
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,390
这正是在改变规则
This is just bending the rules.

83
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,350
不行  对不起.我做不到…
No, no. I'm sorry, I...

84
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,770
我做不到… 我不能再过这样的生活了
I can't. I can't live like this.

85
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,530
每一次我看着我的妻子 我都会在她的眼神里看到我的罪过
Every time I look at my wife, I see my own guilt reflected in her eyes.

86
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,360
哇  李  你还挺有诗意的
Oh, wow. Wow, Lee, that is really poetic of you,

87
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,660
但你用不着想得那么多
but you don't need to make that big of a deal out of this.

88
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,330
听着  这件事情对我很重要  卡拉
Well, it is a big deal, Kara, it is.

89
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,290
很重要
It is.

90
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,420
好吧
Okay.

91
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,130
这样吧  我不会离婚 你也不用再偷偷摸摸了
So I won't divorce and you won't cheat.

92
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,640
那我们俩会怎样?
So where does that leave us?

93
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,140
深陷其中
Trapped.

94
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,860
最后五个赛昂人是谁?
Who are the Final Five?

95
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,780
我可能是个赛昂人
I could be a Cylon.

96
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,950
她不太对劲
She's not well.

97
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,330
怎么了  赫拉?
What's the matter, Hera?

98
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,250
没事的  赫拉
It's okay, Hera.

99
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,090
没事的
It's okay.

100
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,970
我在这儿陪着你呢
I'm here for you.

101
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,040
我们的碳同位素测定显示
TYROL: Our initial radio carbon dating

102
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,420
这座庙至少有4 000年历史了
suggests the Temple's at least 4,000 years old,

103
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,300
正好和第十三个部落大批离去的时间相符
which lines up with the exodus of the Thirteenth Tribe.

104
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,550
你真的认为你已经找到了那五人的圣庙?
ROSLIN: Do you really think you've found the Temple of Five?

105
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,760
是的
Yeah.

106
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,260
我是从我父亲关于此方面研究的书上认出来的 总统女士
I recognize it from the books in my father's study, Madam President.

107
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,680
他是个牧师 而这五人圣庙是我们信仰中重要的组成部分 
He was a priest and the Temple of Five was an important part of our faith...

108
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,480
应该说是他的信仰
Well, his faith, anyway.

109
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,560
这个地方是不是可能和朱庇特之眼有关  军士长?
Could this place be related to the Eye of Jupiter, Chief?

110
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,900
你理解我的意思了  总统女士
TYROL: You got me, Madam President.

111
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,780
我只隐约记得一些 我在我父亲不注意的时候
All I know is the stuff I kind of remember

112
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,030
在他的研究中偷偷看到的东西
from sneaking into my dad's study when he wasn't looking.

113
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,950
朱庇特之眼? 这到底是讲什么的?
The Eye of Jupiter. What exactly are we talking about?

114
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,450
据圣卷轴上所说  
According to the scriptures,

115
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,910
是一个被第十三个部落所遗落的记号
it's a marker that was left behind by the Thirteenth Tribe.

116
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,040
它应该能指出前往地球的道路
It's supposed to point the way to Earth.

117
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,340
军士长  进入警戒状态  我是阿达玛
Chief, we're on alert. This is Adama.

118
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,090
上将  我是盖塔中尉  在作战指挥中心里
Admiral, Lieutenant Gaeta in the CIC.

119
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,760
我们的雷达探测到数个目标
We have multiple dradis contacts.

120
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,550
4艘赛昂基地之星刚刚跳跃过来  
Four Cylon baseships just jumped into view.

121
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,680
我马上到
On our way!

122
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,600
报告情况
Sitrep.

123
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,270
4艘基地之星以高速靠近
Four baseships inbound at high speed.

124
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,610
4艘?
Four!

125
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,110
实际上  这些狗娘养的正好跳跃到我们上方
Bastards practically jumped right on top of us.

126
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,900
舰队正在启动超光速飞行引擎  长官
HOSHI: Fleet's spooling up their FTL drives, sir.

127
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,530
准备跳跃到紧急状况坐标 听您的命令
Preparing to jump to emergency stand-by coordinates on your command.

128
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,990
执行     是的  长官
Do it. Aye, sir.

129
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,710
我们必须保持现有位置  直到所有人都归航才可以离开
We gotta hold this position until everyone's back on board.

130
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,210
有多少人在下面?    很多
How many are down there? Enough.

131
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,750
上将  如果朱庇特之眼真的在那座神庙里
Admiral, if the Eye of Jupiter is somewhere in that Temple

132
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,550
而且它真的指明了通往地球的道路
and it really is a marker on the way to Earth...

133
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,630
那我们决不能让赛昂人得到它!
We can't let the Cylons get their hands on it.

134
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,430
准备发射蝮蛇战机
Standby to launch Vipers.

135
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,930
有什么地方不对劲?  赛昂人并没有发射突袭机
Something's odd here. Cylons aren't launching Raiders.

136
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,640
这些基地之星并没有靠近 全都保持在武器射程之外
Baseships are standing off, outside of weapons range.

137
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,140
真是奇怪
That is odd.

138
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,900
上将
Admiral.

139
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,820
是赛昂基地之星 请求和您通话
It's the Cylon baseship, requesting to speak with you.

140
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,620
帮我接通通讯频道
Put it through the speaker.

141
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,040
我是阿达玛上将
This is Admiral Adama.

142
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:01,766
上将 
Admiral,

143
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:06,010
我真的无法形容听到您的声音是多么的高兴
 I can't tell you what a genuine pleasure it is to hear your voice.

144
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,300
我是盖尤斯・波塔尔
This is Gaius Baltar.

145
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,030
我真不敢相信你让赛昂人登上这艘船
ROSLIN: I can't believe we're allowing Cylons on this ship.

146
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,490
他们一定是情况不妙了
They must want something pretty bad

147
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,320
否则在他们刚刚跳跃过来时 就该进攻了
or else they would've started shooting as soon as they jumped in.

148
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,660
那他们为什么要派波塔尔过来?
Why would they send Baltar?

149
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,250
他们明知道 我们不会相信他的任何一句鬼话
They've got to know we won't believe a word he says.

150
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,830
他愿意说什么就让他说什么
He can say whatever he wants.

151
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,042
他说得越多 
The longer he talks, 

152
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:42,630
我们就能争取越多的时间让李他们撤回来
the more time we have to get Lee and his people off of the planet.

153
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,670
这里气氛紧张  是不是啊?
It feels like old times, doesn't it?

154
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,380
我真不敢相信我是多么地想念这个地方
I can't believe how much I actually miss this place.

155
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,510
你知道你不可能回来了
You know you can't return.

156
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,510
他们会把你从最近的减压舱扔出去 然后举办个盛大的庆祝晚会
They'd toss you out the nearest airlock, and then throw a party.

157
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,520
是啊  我知道
Yes, I know.

158
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,610
但我还是禁不住觉得我终于...
Still, I can't help the feeling I'm finally

159
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,810
回家了
home.

160
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,610
如果你真的是个赛昂人 最后那终极五人中的一个
If you're really a Cylon, a member of the Final Five,

161
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,360
那么这种感觉也就只是你程序的一部分了
these feelings are just part of your programming,

162
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,860
用来伪装的
part of your cover.

163
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,450
如果我最终真的只是个人类
And if I'm a human being after all?

164
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,790
而不是终极五人之一
If I'm not one of the Final Five,

165
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,410
那么这就是我最后一次有机会见到我的同类了
then this is the last chance I'll ever get to see my kind again.

166
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,930
上校  等一下
Colonel, wait.

167
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,300
啊  看看这个  我们应该敬礼吗?
Well, look at this. Should we salute?

168
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,190
那是布玛尔
That's Boomer.

169
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,270
向老头子开枪的那个吗?
TIGH: The one who shot the old man?

170
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,400
看来你刚刚失去了访问本舰的权力
Well, you just lost your visiting privileges.

171
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,490
让那个东西待在这儿直到我们回来  
Hold that thing here until we get back.

172
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,580
是  长官
GUARD: Yes, sir.

173
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,580
你们三个继续跟着来
You three, keep on moving.

174
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,650
劳拉
Laura.

175
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,780
劳拉  我...
Laura, I...

176
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,620
真高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

177
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,390
武器就不需要了吧
Weapons are hardly necessary.

178
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,810
是的  一点儿没错
Yes, exactly.

179
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,480
我们这次来没有任何动武的意思
We come in peace.

180
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,780
你们想要什么?
What do you want?

181
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,820
我们想要朱庇特之眼
We want the Eye of Jupiter.

182
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,910
现在让我们把所有的不信任还有反对  统统丢掉
So let's just skip all the denials and protestations,

183
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,120
直接来说我们所知道的
and go straight to it.

184
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,910
你的人现在就在下面的星球上
We know that you have people on the ground,

185
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,460
我们也知道你们找到了第十三部落最初的聚居地
and we know that you've found the original settlement of the Thirteenth Tribe.

186
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,840
而且我们也很容易推测出
It also doesn't take a lot of deduction to conclude

187
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,510
那个让你们不惜更大的损失而不马上逃走的唯一原因
that the only reason you haven't cut your losses and jumped away by now

188
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,180
就是你们可能已经找到了朱庇特之眼
is that you've probably found the artifact,

189
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,510
但是你们还没有把它带回到舰上
but you haven't been able to retrieve it yet.

190
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,350
我说得对吗  总统女士?
Is that about right, Madam President?

191
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,930
我们的人是在那个星球上 
We have our people on the surface.

192
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,810
我们不能扔下他们不管
We're not leaving them behind.

193
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,230
那是个很感人  但是没什么说服力的解释
That's a touching, but not very convincing idea.

194
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,190
我们在这个小小的星球上偶然相遇的可能性
Look, the chances that we've all converged on this small planet

195
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,110
极其微小
at the same time are infinitesimally small.

196
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,990
那么看来我们都明白这并不是意外
So, we will understand it's not chance.

197
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,280
你们想得到朱庇特之眼  赛昂人也想得到它
You want the Eye, the Cylons want the Eye.

198
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,080
我想分析一下眼下现实的问题
I would like to discuss the practical issues that come to hand,

199
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,120
那就是一些...
and there are some,

200
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,290
让我们可以达成共识的东西
so that we can reach some accommodation.

201
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,130
这个人说得越少  事情越好办
The less this man says, the better this will go.

202
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,760
等一下
Wait a minute.

203
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,760
如果不是因为我  赛昂人早就在刚刚跳跃过来的时候
If it wasn't for me, the Cylons would have blown you out of the sky

204
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,800
就把你们炸上天了
two seconds after we'd arrived.

205
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,100
我想你可以单独处理好这件事情 如果你可以忍受的了的话
I think you can handle this alone, if you can stomach it.

206
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,230
这样一来  我救了你一命…
So, I've saved your life

207
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,770
再一次
again.

208
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,310
已经是第几次了?  我都有些记不清了
How many times is that, now? Because I'm beginning to lose count.

209
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,110
如果不是我  你们早就全死光了!
If it wasn't for me, you'd all be dead!

210
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,070
你们能开出什么价码?
What's your offer?

211
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,990
你们把朱比特之眼交给我们 我们放你们走
You give us the Eye of Jupiter, we'll let you go.

212
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,370
然后我们会交出波塔尔
And we'll throw in Baltar.

213
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,040
你到底在说些什么?      的确
What are you talking about now? Indeed.

214
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,290
你在说什么 ?      我在即兴而谈
What's he saying? I'm improvising.

215
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,500
放入更多可以换来合作的筹码
Throw in something to sweeten the pot.

216
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,510
另外我觉得上将和总统女士
Besides, I suspect that the Admiral and Madam President

217
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,590
都愿意与他们曾经的领导者在一起单独相处一会儿
would enjoy some nice, quiet, private time with the former leader.

218
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,220
我说得对吧?
Am I right?

219
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,020
的确值得考虑
Worth thinking about.

220
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,610
显然我们在考虑
Definitely worth thinking about.

221
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,240
如果不是那身制服 这里再也不会是你的家了
Despite that uniform, it's not your home anymore.

222
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,700
我做出了自己的决定 我也知道自己忠诚于哪方
I've made my choice and I know where my loyalties lie.

223
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,590
那如果我告诉你  你的女儿还活着呢?
What if I told you that your daughter was still alive?

224
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,090
那我只能说你在撒谎
I'd say you were lying.

225
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,010
确实有人在说谎
Well, someone's lying.

226
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,640
但决不是我
But it's not me.

227
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,430
赫拉还活着
Hera's alive.

228
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,150
至少现在还是
At least for now.

229
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,150
她病了  但我们不知道是什么引起的
She's ill, and we don't know why.

230
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,690
是吗?
Yeah, right.

231
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,530
在新卡布里卡大撤退时  波塔尔发现了她
Baltar found her on New Caprica during the evacuation.

232
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,990
她现在在我们的基地之星上
She's on our baseship right now.

233
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,370
据我们所了解 她当时被藏在劳拉・罗丝琳的学校里
From what we could gather, she was hidden at Laura Roslin's school,

234
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,880
也就是说罗丝琳可能事先布置好了所有的一切
which means that she probably planned the whole thing in the first place.

235
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,920
我不想听这些  看住她
I don't need to listen to this. Watch her.

236
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,220
他们想让你以为你的女儿死了
They let you think that she was dead!

237
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,590
你不会对一个人类做出那样的事 只会对一个"东西"这么做
You don't do that to a person, you do that to a thing!

238
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,600
你的那些朋友们也是这样看你的  莎伦
That's what your friends think of you, Sharon!

239
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,470
你不是他们中的一员  你只是一架机器
You're not one of them! You're a thing!

240
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,100
我们不会把通往地球的钥匙给你们的
We're not giving you the key to finding Earth.

241
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,690
你休想将朱比特之眼从那个星球带到你舰上
You try bringing it up from that planet and see what happens.

242
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,990
我们现在是4比1
We outnumber you four to one.

243
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,710
现在我说了算
I'm setting the terms now.

244
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:43,550
只要你胆敢对卡拉狄加或是在那个星球上的人发动进攻
Make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planet's surface,

245
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,010
我就会把我所有的核武器
I'll launch every nuke I've got.

246
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,260
扔到那个星球上
Lay waste to the entire continent.

247
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,390
你在虚张声势
You're bluffing.

248
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,190
你和我们一样想找到地球
You want to find Earth as much as we do.

249
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,320
守卫  把他们带回他们船上去
Guards, escort them back to their ship.

250
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,740
是  长官
GUARD: Yes, sir.

251
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,510
我怎么样才能知道我们在找什么呢? 
APOLLO: Well, it would help if I knew what I was looking for.

252
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,430
他真的像一只眼睛吗?
Does it really look like an eye?

253
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,930
我不知道  李
ROSLIN: I don't know, Lee.

254
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,020
我看过圣卷轴  那上面有提到
I've looked at the scriptures and they make reference

255
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,390
朱比特之眼被放在某种寺庙里
to the Eye being left in some sort of Temple,

256
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,850
但却没有特别的描述
but there's no physical description.

257
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,110
我们只知道它会指明通往地球的路
All we know for sure is that it supposedly points the way to Earth.

258
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,770
你相信那些吗?
And you believe that?

259
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,530
赛昂人相信 我不敢说他们就是对的
The Cylons do. I can't take a chance that they're right.

260
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,030
如果他们试图进入那寺庙
If it looks like they're gonna get into the Temple,

261
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,280
给你的命令是把那庙炸毁
your order is to blow it.

262
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,750
明白了  我有多少时间？
Understood. What's my...

263
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,000
怎么回事儿?
What's going on?

264
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,960
赛昂人在干扰 所有频道都是
The Cylons are jamming the wireless, every frequency.

265
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,050
我们要想办法恢复通信
Okay, we need to establish hard communications,

266
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,590
想出个防守这寺庙的计划 同时让泰罗尔继续搜索
work out a plan to defend this Temple while Tyrol searches.

267
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,260
用什么来防守? 十几个陆战队员和五个军官?
Defend it with what? A dozen Marines, maybe five more military?

268
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,140
我们只好征召平民入伍
We're gonna have to draft the civilians.

269
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,520
我可以提一个你肯定不喜欢的建议吗?
Can I make a suggestion that you won't like?

270
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,770
你的建议什么时候让人舒服过?
Do you make any other kind?

271
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,940
让山姆来指挥那些民兵
Use Sam to command the civilians.

272
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,740
你在开玩笑吧
You're not serious.

273
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,410
李       你好  山姆
Lee. Hey, Sam.

274
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,830
嗨
Hi.

275
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,170
我听说你也下来了
Heard you were coming down.

276
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,840
除非有紧急情况  这段时间 我们还真难在一起
Guess it takes an emergency to get us in the same room these days.

277
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,590
我们能否迟些再说这个
Can we do this later, please?

278
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,930
山姆  我们想让你指挥民兵
APOLLO: Sam, I need you to command the civilians.

279
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,600
把他们变成战队小分队
Form them into fire teams.

280
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,390
我会通过军士部署命令....    哇 哇
I'll give my deployment orders through Sergeant... Whoa, whoa.

281
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,150
等等  部署命令?  战斗小分队?
Wait. Deployment orders? Fire teams?

282
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,780
有些人根本就没拿过枪
Come on, some of these guys have never even held a rifle before.

283
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,950
在把平民训练成士兵方面  你应该是专家了
Well, you're supposed to be the expert in turning civilians into soldiers.

284
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,870
不  不  不  我们那时是游击队
No, no, no. We were guerilla fighters.

285
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,280
知道吗?打一枪  
All right? Hit and run.

286
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,790
换一个地方 让敌人手忙脚乱
Keep moving, keep the enemy off-balance.

287
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,250
我从来没有防守过一块固定阵地 这可是完全不同的
I've never had to defend a fixed position, that's a whole different game.

288
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,870
这样的话  那你只好尽快学会怎么去做了
Well, then, you're just gonna have to learn it fast,

289
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,500
因为我们已经决定了 我们要防守这个固定阵地
because that's what we're doing, we're defending this fixed position

290
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,300
直到军士长找到朱比特之眼
until the Chief finds this Eye of Jupiter.

291
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,510
好啊  你是想让我们冒着生命危险
Oh, okay, so you want us to risk our lives

292
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,470
去保护一些你还没有找到的东西?!
for something that you haven't even found yet?

293
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,340
听着  山姆 我甚至不清楚那鬼东西是不是真的存在
Listen, Sam, I'm not even sure it exists.

294
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,930
但我没必要告诉你所有那些他妈的细节
But I don't have to tell you every little gods-damn detail...

295
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,470
你知道你需要跟我解释什么吗?
No, you know what you have to explain to me...

296
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,680
嗨 嗨
Hey, hey, hey...

297
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,560
少校负责这次行动  清楚吗?
The Major's in charge of this one, okay?

298
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,020
好吗?
Okay?

299
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,190
哼
Huh.

300
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,900
是啊  我当然不想打扰你和你的少校
Well, I certainly wouldn't want to step between you and your Major.

301
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,790
我想一切进展顺利
Well, I thought that went really well.

302
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,250
他会服从命令的
He'll do it.

303
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,710
他最好是
He better.

304
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,360
我想尼克  
I miss Nicky.

305
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,070
你觉得他一切都好吗？
Do you think he's okay?

306
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,490
是的  他一定很好
Yes, he's fine.

307
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,370
他在卡拉狄加上 不会有事的
He's on Galactica. He's fine.

308
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,740
我也希望是
I know.

309
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,580
我小的时候曾恨所有关于信仰的东西
You know, when I was growing up, I hated everything about the faith,

310
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,550
那些规矩  那些仪式  那些永无休止的饭桌上的争论
the rules, the rituals, endless discussions at the dinner table.

311
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,300
我曾经偷偷进入我妈妈用来祈祷的房间 那是最神圣的地方
I used to sneak into my mom's prayer room, you know, holiest of the holies,

312
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,180
我会光着身子拿着黄色杂志跳来跳去 就是想藐视神灵  
and I would dance around naked with porn magazines just to defy the Gods

313
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,770
让他们都滚开
and tell them to frak off.

314
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,350
我意思是  我不知道是怎么来到这个地方的
I mean, I don't even know how I found this place.

315
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,110
我只是觉得想开始...走路  然后突然间  我就在这儿了
I just got this urge to start walking, and then suddenly here it is.

316
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,070
当你在这里的时候 你应该看看自己的表情
Well, you should see the look on your face when you're in here.

317
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,280
是一种敬仰
There's this reverence.

318
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,960
甚至说话都轻声了不少
You even talk softer.

319
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,670
我能在这儿感觉到什么
I feel something in here.

320
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,670
一些接近真理的东西
Something true.

321
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,850
但我确实正在这里布置引线 在这个特殊的地方
But here I am setting charges in this special place.

322
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,270
最为神圣的地方
The holiest of the holies. This is

323
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,730
这个五人神庙
the Temple of Five.

324
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,320
如果我父母看到这些
If my parents could see this.

325
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,740
看到我正准备把它炸掉
And I'm gonna blow it up.

326
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,590
我注意到一些不正常的恒星辐射
GAETA: I noticed some anomalies in the solar radiation belt.

327
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,220
我对这个星系恒星的震动模式进行了分析
I made an analysis of the star's vibration modes.

328
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,060
很确定的是  这颗恒星很不稳定
Sure enough, it appears to be highly unstable.

329
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,390
如果你愿意相信的话 它即将转变成一颗超新星
If you can believe it, on the verge of going supernova.

330
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,690
何时?
When?

331
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,770
可能是明天  也可能是一年后
It could be tomorrow, it could be next year.

332
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,230
无法知道确切时间  长官
There's no way of knowing for sure, sir.

333
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,280
一旦它开始转变 我们唯一可能感测到的警报
When it does happen, the only warning that we're likely to get

334
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,820
将是疾速的氦闪光 那时我们将不得不在 
is a fast helium flash, at which point we'll have to jump out of here

335
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,120
整个星系被摧毁之前马上离开这里
before it obliterates the entire planetary system.

336
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,330
长官  我并不是那些寻找神谕的人之一
Sir, I'm not one to look for religious signs,

337
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,540
但我实在是想不明白一些奇怪的事情
but I can't get my head around these odds.

338
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:59,670
人类和赛昂人竟然在这颗星相遇
That human and Cylon both converge on this planet at this exact moment,

339
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,840
就在它即将转变成超新星的时候
just as the star is about to go supernova?

340
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,350
我不是个信仰宗教的人  盖塔先生  你们都知道
I'm not a religious person, Mr. Gaeta, as you both know.

341
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,350
如果这是神灵的旨意
So if this is the work of a higher power,

342
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,270
那他们这次可是幽默过了头
then they have one hell of a sense of humor.

343
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,860
我们在相持 很容易预知
We have a stand-off. Very predictable.

344
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,895
他们拥有朱比特之眼  
They have the Eye,

345
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:24,700
如果我们试图夺走它  他们会用核武器毁掉它
 and they'll nuke it if we try to take it,

346
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,990
如果他们试图把它带回到卡拉狄加上 我们会把他们摧毁
and we'll shoot them down if they try bringing it up to Galactica.

347
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,675
你确定他们找到了朱比特之眼吗? 
Are we sure they have it?

348
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,370
我们怎么知道他们不是在虚张声势?
 How do we know they're not bluffing?

349
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,870
不知道
You don't.

350
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,710
我们三个认为我们不应该冒险行事
We Threes feel that we can't afford to take the chance.

351
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,670
我觉得我们失去了大局观
I think we're missing the big picture here.

352
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,220
我们有机会在这个宇宙中永远去除
We have the opportunity to rid the universe

353
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,470
人类这块顽疾
of the human pestilence once and for all.

354
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,520
我们可以在拿到朱比特之眼
We can discuss that after we get the Eye of Jupiter,

355
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,060
并找到地球之后再讨论这个问题
after we find the path to Earth.

356
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,730
让我来指明那其实并不重要 无论我们是在5天之内找到地球
Let me point out that it doesn't matter if we find Earth in five days,

357
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,610
又或是要花上5000年的时间
or if we find Earth in 5,000 years.

358
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,490
我们毕竟是机器
We're machines,

359
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,660
我们会最终成为欣赏那伟大奇迹的人
we'll still be around to savor the great miracle.

360
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,080
所以任由他们毁掉朱比特之眼吧
So let them destroy the Eye,

361
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,960
如果他们真的已经得到了它
if indeed they have it.

362
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,120
我们必须把握好这千载难逢的时机
We have to take advantage of the situation

363
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,500
消灭卡拉狄加以除后患
and take down Galactica once and for all.

364
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,550
或者我们就在这里待着什么也不做
Or we could stand here and do nothing.

365
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,010
我们并不是没有行动  卡维尔
We're not doing nothing, Cavil.

366
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,350
行动正在进行
Plans are in motion.

367
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,390
对不起  不过那是什么意思?
I'm sorry. What was that?

368
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,100
戴安娜
D'Anna.

369
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,890
我们一跳跃过来 就派遣重型运输机
I've put a Heavy Raider down on the planet's surface

370
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,480
去了星球表面
as soon as we jumped in.

371
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,110
我想那将是我们最好的机会来躲避他们的雷达探测
I thought that would be our best chance of slipping by their dradis.

372
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,070
看来我们成功了
Seems I was right.

373
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,780
有什么特别的原因解释为何我们没有被通知参与策划的吗?
Was there any particular reason the rest of us weren't involved in this decision?

374
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,780
这是个"需要通知"的任务
It was a need-to-know mission.

375
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,910
所以现在我告诉你们  因为你们需要知道
So, now I am telling you, because you need to know.

376
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,620
重点是 我们已经切断了人类部队之间的通讯联络
The point is, we have cut off their troops' communications

377
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,830
而且我们的部队已经登陆到星球上
and we have put our own troops on the ground.

378
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,040
只要我们夺过朱比特之眼
So, as soon as the Centurions retrieve the Eye,

379
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,130
你们就可以摧毁卡拉狄加了
you can take out Galactica.

380
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,950
好了  这就是我们的方案  我们没有选择余地
Okay, here's the deal. We're out of options.

381
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,160
赛昂人把我们看得死死的
The Cylons have got us pinned on this rock

382
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,620
我们唯一的出路就是 
and our only way out of here is to hold this place

383
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,540
在卡拉狄加的救援到来前守住这个地方
until Galactica can send a rescue party.

384
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,170
所以  我要把大家分成两队  听好了嘛?
So I've divided you into two teams, okay?

385
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,670
第一队负责向整个营地分发弹药
Team One is gonna be distributing ammunition throughout the camp.

386
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,840
第二队负责制造泰里恩地雷
Team Two is gonna be making homemade tylium mines.

387
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,930
很好
Great. Great.

388
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,050
我知道这不是什么伟大的动作
I know that's not glamorous work,

389
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,140
但是在赛昂人向我们射击的时候 
but we're gonna need the extra firepower

390
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,430
我们需要点火力
in case the Cylons decide to take a shot at us.

391
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:03,060
我知道你们中有些人害怕
Look, I know some of you are scared,

392
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,150
这种情况正常的  因为我也在害怕
and that's okay, because I'm scared, too.

393
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:11,110
但是我们只要保持冷静 做好该做的事 就能成功
But if we keep our heads and we do our jobs, we can do this.

394
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,370
我们可以一起离开这个地方的
We can all get out of here in one piece.

395
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,740
这里是你们的名字还有各自的任务
Now, Barolay has the list of your names and your assignments.

396
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,000
大家都要记好了  我们外面碰头
Make sure you get with her. I'll see you outside.

397
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,420
说实话  你讲得真不错
That was good, honest.

398
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,720
你是个好的领导
You'd make a good officer.

399
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,720
好领导? 
An officer, huh?

400
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,850
就像你?
Like you?

401
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,560
说起来都道貌岸然的 做起来就不一回事了
Someone who swears an oath and knows how to keep it?

402
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,360
我不清楚你讲的是什么意思
I'm not really sure what you think is going on...

403
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,490
别惹我  听到没有?  我不是笨蛋
Don't insult me, okay. I'm not stupid.

404
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,080
我了解我老婆  我了解她是什么样人
I know my wife. I know how she is.

405
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,080
我们结婚都有一年半了
We've been married for a year-and-a-half.

406
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,870
什么 你以为你是第一个?
What, you think you're the first?

407
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,170
我选择和卡拉结婚  那是我的事情
I chose to marry Kara. That's my business.

408
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,720
但是你
But you?

409
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,720
我不清楚你他妈的到底想干什么
I don't know what the hell you think you're trying to do.

410
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,060
我在准备打仗
Look, I'm trying to fight a war.

411
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,690
我在想如何把大家一起带离这个地方
I'm trying to get these people off this rock in one piece.

412
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,020
任务第一  少校
Anything for the cause, Major.

413
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,200
盖尤斯  我差点就看到了剩下的那五个赛昂人
Gaius, I am on the verge of seeing the faces of the Final Five Cylons.

414
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,750
可能是神的脸庞呢
Maybe the face of God himself.

415
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,380
五束神谕之光升起 穿透日光
The Five Lights of the apocalypse rising, struggling towards the light,

416
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,720
只有进入神庙的人才能看到神谕 只有上天选中的人
sins revealed only to those who enter the Temple, only to the Chosen One...

417
00:32:53,800 --> 00:33:03,730
选中的人 选中的人
The Chosen One... The Chosen One...

418
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,230
他们五个在等着我  选中的人
The Five await me. The Chosen One...

419
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,480
盖尤斯  我离真相是如此的近
Gaius, I'm so close to knowing the truth.

420
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,940
什么真相
CAPRICA SIX: What truth?

421
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,320
卡布里卡
Caprica.

422
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,160
我原以为我们三个一直都可以分享些什么
I'd like to think that we three have shared something,

423
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,950
都能越过分出彼此的隔膜
have transcended the barriers that separate people,

424
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,120
但是现在  不知为什么  时间越长
and yet, somehow, the more time goes on,

425
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,380
我越感觉到自己像个局外的人
the more I find myself on the outside looking in.

426
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,380
好吧  根本就不是你想的那样 对吧?
Well, that's not the case at all, is it?

427
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,840
因为我们三个  是个整体
Because we three, we're integral,

428
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,050
我们是一部份.  我们结束了
we're part of... We're finished.

429
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,100
波塔尔和我的命运跟你没关系 卡布里卡
Baltar and my destiny lie separate from yours, Caprica.

430
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:01,620
五道光芒只会出现在进入神庙的人面前
The Five Lights will be revealed only to those who enter the Temple.

431
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,250
我们一定要下到那个星球去
We have to go down to the planet.

432
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,540
只有你和我才能看到
Only you and I can see this through.

433
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,250
你在找什么?
What are you after?

434
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,630
你们追寻的到底是什么秘密?
What is this secret that you keep pursuing?

435
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,220
你们必须告诉我真相 
You have to tell me the truth.

436
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,680
我爱你们
I love you both.

437
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,300
我们也爱你
We love you, too.

438
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,140
但这是你不能和我们共享的
But this is something you cannot share with us.

439
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,690
是你们不能和我共享的?
Something I can't share with you?

440
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,060
在别人都想让你死的时候  我还爱着你
I loved you when everyone else wanted you dead.

441
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,730
那  听好了  你不能误解我们
Now, look, you mustn't misunderstand.

442
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,490
这不是我们个人的事情
It's not personal.

443
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,820
这是先行者的事 这就像你过去所说的  先行者的事
It's transcendent. It's like what you said, it's transcendent.

444
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,750
为我们祈祷吧  卡布里卡
Pray for us, Caprica.

445
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
我们也为你祈祷
We'll be praying for you.

446
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,190
好的  他想让我们去设置个前方观察哨
Okay, he wants us to set up forward observation posts

447
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,110
需要用有线连接到我们的大本营
hardwired back to base for communications.

448
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,740
设立的位置一定要在战略交叉点上
The obs are gonna be staggered at strategic locations,

449
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,700
这样如果出现赛昂人  能尽可能多的给我们预警 
giving us as much warning as possible if there is a Cylon advance.

450
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,580
而我们只有一架猛禽机 就由瑟瑞丝上尉负责驾驶过去侦查
Since we only have one Raptor, Captain Thrace will fly point.

451
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,740
噢  爽死了
Oh, joy.

452
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:31,250
无线通信不能用 所以如果你碰上他们的时候 不要和他们交火
Wireless is dead, so if you do make contact, do not engage.

453
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,880
要在近距离干扰他们的信号
Fly to the closest observation post,

454
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,540
然后就马上赶回大本营
have them relay the information back to command.

455
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,380
一定要了解到火力情况 他们的行进方向  还有地点
Be sure to note force strength, direction of march and position.

456
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,130
我都想了两遍了  中尉
I have flown recon once or twice, Lieutenant.

457
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,390
格里戈斯  你和瓦里奇要在这里搭设个观察哨
Griggs, you and Varrick are gonna set up an observation post here.

458
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,270
亨涅克和迪特  你们去这里
Henick and Ditko, you go here.

459
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,480
那谁是幸运的三号呢?  
And who gets lucky number three?

460
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,360
那是菲舍尔军士和我
That would be Sergeant Fischer and me.

461
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,440
你还有什么问题吗  上尉?
Do you have a problem with that, Captain?

462
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,110
没 我们1小时内出发
No. We go in an hour.

463
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,330
大本营  这里是火狐一号  大本营  这里是火狐一号
Green Base, Foxfire One. Green Base, Foxfire One.

464
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,870
我们开始买卖了  完毕
We are open for business, over.

465
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,470
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

466
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,520
别告诉我你没到我的信号
Tell me you're seeing this.

467
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,980
她发信号了  
DUALLA: She's relaying a message.

468
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,020
有情况了
It's Centurions!

469
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,190
星芭被击中了 
Starbuck's been hit!

470
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,110
再说一次  星芭正在坠落
I say again, Starbuck's going down!

471
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,550
在圣卷经文上没有什么关于这个眼的说法
There's really not much more on the Eye in these scriptures,

472
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,220
可有些关于这座庙的有趣说法
but there's several interesting stories about the Temple.

473
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,380
听这里
Listen to this...

474
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,890
"五名牧师的身后雕塑了五根柱子
"Five pillars of the Temple were fashioned after

475
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,220
用来献祭给不能透露姓名的..."
"the Five Priests devoted to the One Whose Name Cannot... "

476
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,470
劳拉   
Laura.

477
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,730
怎么了?
What?

478
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,560
和其他赛昂人一起过来的那个我们称为布玛尔的人
The Cylon we know as Boomer arrived with the others.

479
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:24,740
她告诉我们的莎伦  那个小孩还活着
She told our Sharon that her child was alive,

480
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,620
而那个小孩现在一艘赛昂人的基地之星上
and that she was onboard one of the Cylon baseships.

481
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,200
同时小孩也在你新卡布里卡的学校里出现过
And that she had been seen on New Caprica, in your school.

482
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,880
那小孩还活着
The child is alive.

483
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,970
是的  是的
Yes, yes.

484
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,430
是的  我是当时把她养在学校里
The child was at the school. Yes, I kept her there.

485
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,690
并且事后怀疑她被赛昂人捕获了
And we suspected that the Cylons captured her during the exodus

486
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,230
是的  这是真的
from New Caprica. Yes, it's true.

487
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,700
听着  你需要明白这件事是当...
Listen, the thing you might want to know is that when...

488
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,380
你知道我们是怎么过来的吗?
Do you have any idea what we've gone through?

489
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,350
你们所有人
You, of all people...

490
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,230
知道失去孩子是什么感觉吗?
Know what it's like to lose a child.

491
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,070
不同的是你的孩子还活着
The difference is, your child is still alive.

492
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:51,910
最后… 希望你们能感到高兴
Eventually, I hope you become grateful of that.

493
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,550
我想见她
I want to see her.

494
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,680
你说她坠落是什么意思  坠落在哪?
What do you mean she's gone down? Gone down where?

495
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,430
在峡谷北部的什么地方
Somewhere in the North Valley.

496
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,140
好了  让你的人准备好  
Okay, get your men on the line.

497
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,270
装满弹药   哇 哇
Full ammo loads. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

498
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,690
他们从北边过来了  卡拉怎么办
They're coming from the north. What about Kara?

499
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,230
我们要组织个救援队  对不对?
We're gonna set up a rescue party, right?

500
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,030
不
No.

501
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,950
我们没有人手 我们只能坚守岗位
We don't have the manpower. We have to defend the position.

502
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,990
李  她可能会死在那的
Lee, she could be dying out there.

503
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,450
是  我知道  山姆  我知道
Yeah, I know that, Sam. I know.

504
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,200
但是我们在这 赛昂人还在向这边行军
But we are thin on the ground here and the Cylons are on the march.

505
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,460
我们救不了她 我们只能坚守岗位
We can't help her. We have to hold our positions.

506
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,340
你他妈的疯了吗?
Are you out of your frakking mind?

507
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,760
刚从雷达中捕捉到六架突袭机从赛昂人舰队中出发
We just picked up six Heavy Raiders falling away from the Cylon fleet.

508
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,720
明显目的地是那星球
Definitely heading down toward the planet.

509
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,220
我不懂
I don't get it.

510
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,230
它们应该知道我们能看到的
They have to know we see them.

511
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,020
它们在考验我们
They're testing us.

512
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,230
想知道我们说用核弹攻击这颗星球是不是装腔作势
Want to know if we're bluffing about nuking the planet.

513
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,320
幸运的是我们在使诈  
Well, unfortunately, we are bluffing.

514
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,190
我们有吗?
Are we?

515
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,240
Hoshi先生    是  长官
Mr. Hoshi. HOSHI: Aye, sir.

516
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,870
下令将地面攻击核弹装入4至10号发射管道
Order nuclear ground strike missiles into launch tubes four through ten.

517
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,370
是  长官
HOSHI: Aye, sir.

518
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,790
以下是核弹攻击命令
This is a nuclear mission order.

519
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,590
少校是对的
The Major's right.

520
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,090
在我们要坚守这里的时候 我们没有额外的兵力能分出去
We don't have any troops to spare if we're gonna hold this position.

521
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,760
放弃这里!
Screw this position!

522
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,970
听着  我们可以占据这些山  开展游击战
