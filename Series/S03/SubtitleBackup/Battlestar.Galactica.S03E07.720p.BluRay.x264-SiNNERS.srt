1
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,560
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》 前情提要
HELO: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,820
舰队里的一些人相信 地球的传说
Some people in the Fleet believe that the legend of Earth held,

3
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,690
也许是我们生存下去的最好保证
perhaps, the greatest promise for our survival.

4
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,990
知道怎么找到它吗?
Do you know how to find it?

5
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,860
不太清楚
Not really, no.

6
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,120
有个希望 如果你知道去地球的方法
There was a hope, my hope, that if you knew the way to Earth,

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,660
那能确保让你活得更久一些
it would justify keeping you alive a little longer.

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,250
我不知道地球的具体位置
Now when I say that I do not know exactly where Earth is,

9
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,790
并不意味我不知道 
that is not to say that I do not know

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,080
大量关于地球大概位置的信息
a very great deal about its probable location.

11
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,340
那艘基地之星
DORAL: A Baseship,

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,260
就是我们派过去调查狮子星云中脉冲星的那艘
the one we sent to investigate the pulsars in the Lion nebula,

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,420
我们失去了联络
we've lost contact.

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,630
失踪的基地之星
CAPRICA SIX: The missing Baseship,

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,220
可能感染了某种病毒
it's been infected by some kind of disease.

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,930
如果一个感染的赛昂人死亡
If an infected Cylon dies

17
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,220
把病毒带着一起返回了复活船 
and carries this disease with them into a Resurrection ship,

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,560
那可能会快速蔓延 会威胁到我们整个族群
it could rapidly spread, potentially infecting our entire race.

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,350
只要我们其中一个复活了 那个病毒就会跟随而入
If one of us is resurrected, the disease will follow.

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,730
没有一个赛昂人能不被感染地登上那艘船
Then no Cylon can board that ship without risking infection.

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,650
我去 是的 我去
I'll go. Yes, I'll go.

22
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,240
我可以去那个基地之星
I can go to the Baseship.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,320
我可以对上面的赛昂人进行观察 检查他们的身体状况
I can make observations about the Cylons, their physical condition,

24
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,290
带回关于让你们都在恐惧的病毒的信息
bring back information about this disease which now threatens all of you.

25
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,910
你知道这是什么吗?
BALTAR: Do you know what this is?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,290
肯定是某种信标
It must be some kind of beacon.

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,590
第13部落遗留下来的
It must have been left here by the Thirteenth Tribe.

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,470
那个信标带有病毒 是人类留下来毁灭我们的
A beacon carried the disease, left by some humans like you to destroy us.

29
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,590
你没发现被感染船上有什么可疑的吗?
You noticed nothing suspicious on the infected ship?

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,760
没有什么特别的
Nothing whatsoever.

31
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,640
我和你一样困惑
I am just as baffled as you are.

32
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,520
就如那份手稿所写 
RACETRACK: Just like the scriptures say.

33
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,360
就在那里  狮头星云  还有闪耀的眼睛
There it is, the Lion's Head nebula and the Blinking Eye.

34
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,360
我的天 那是通往地球的道路
Holy crap, it's the road to Earth!

35
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,290
这里是战斗分队  A计划准备完毕
APOLLO: This is Combat, dressed and ready, plan A.

36
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,750
我们正在接近基地之星
We are approaching the Baseship.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,430
这很反常
It is just so wrong.

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,440
到底里面发生了什么?
What the hell happened here?

39
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,900
不管发生了什么 对我们来说都是新的机遇
ATHENA: Whatever this is, it's something new.

40
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,900
执行
Go.

41
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,910
阿波罗  这是卡拉狄加  开始行动
Apollo, Galactica. You are cleared hot.

42
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,200
收到 卡拉狄加
APOLLO: Roger that, Galactica.

43
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,660
我们现在离它相当近
We're in pretty close now.

44
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,540
可用肉眼观察它 飞船看起来没有战斗能力了
By the look of it, that ship's in no condition to put up a fight.

45
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,460
我从未见过这种情况  我们继续吗?  
I've never seen anything like this. Shall we proceed?

46
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,090
坐好了 伙计们
Hang on, guys!

47
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,630
多加小心  阿波罗
HELO: Use extreme caution, Apollo.

48
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,330
设置防御带  准备进入
APOLLO: Set perimeter. Up inside, everyone.

49
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,930
卡拉狄加 我是阿波罗 我们进来了
Galactica, Apollo. We're in.

50
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,320
卡拉狄加 我是阿波罗 没有生命迹象
Galactica, Apollo. No sign of life.

51
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,830
飞船看起来是被遗弃并关闭了
Ship appears to be abandoned and powering down.

52
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,390
见鬼了?
APOLLO: What the hell?

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,530
上帝 这里发生过什么?
Gods. What happened here?

54
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,910
我不知道 但他们该死的复活船有得忙了
I don't know, but their frakking Resurrection ship's gonna overheat.

55
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,460
卡拉狄加  我是阿波罗  我们到了控制中心
Galactica, Apollo. We've reached the control center.

56
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,210
有30...也许是40具人形赛昂的尸体
Thirty, maybe forty dead skin jobs.

57
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,550
马赛厄斯 设置防御带!
Mathias, set a perimeter!

58
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,010
莎伦...雅典娜  去看看能从电脑那里找到什么
Sharon, Athena, see what you can pick up in the computers.

59
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,470
分成3个火力小分队  每个队守一个门  快去
MATHIAS: Three fire teams, each doorway. Go!

60
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,770
是 长官
MARINE: Yes, sir.

61
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,480
好的 我准备连入数据库
ATHENA: Okay, I'm gonna try to call up the database.

62
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,780
如果我能联接上 把固体继电器导入那边的液体中
If I get a connection, put the SSR leads in the water over there.

63
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,490
降低错误检校级别 来扩大数据传输带宽
Reduce the error correction levels for highest throughput.

64
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,460
你确定想这么做吗?
RACETRACK: You sure you wanna do that?

65
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,000
就这么做了
ATHENA: It's how it works.

66
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,390
你还好吗?
You okay?

67
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,980
还好  数据库已经差不多都损坏了
Yeah. The data points are almost completely corroded.

68
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,020
我不知道我能够得到什么信息 但我会试的
I don't know if I'm gonna get much out of here, but let's try.

69
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,450
进行得怎么样了?
What is going on?

70
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,120
已进入所有防御带
MARINE: We're now inside all perimeters.

71
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,080
妈的! 这个还活着呢!
Frak me! This one's alive!

72
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,920
这儿! 我们找到个活的!
We got a live one over here!

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,920
丹利 彼得斯 掩护大家!
MATHIAS: Danelli, Peters, cover the Major!

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,050
他们是活的!
APOLLO: They're alive!

75
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,760
卡拉狄加 我是阿波罗 我们找到1 2 3 4 
Galactica, Apollo. We've got one, two, three, four,

76
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,850
5个活的赛昂人
five living skin jobs down here.

77
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,390
我重复一次 5个活着的
I say again, five... Five living.

78
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,310
你们开火了吗?
HELO: Are you taking fire?

79
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,350
没有 没有
Negative, negative.

80
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,850
他们看起来状况不妙
They seem in pretty bad shape.

81
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,270
不要大意 如果他们有什么危险举动
Don't take any chances. If they make any threatening moves...

82
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,650
相信我吧
APOLLO: You can trust me on that one.

83
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,110
趴下
MARINE: Stay down!

84
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,990
上尉  我们该怎么办?  要把他们带出去吗?
Major, what do we do? Should we take them out?

85
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,660
不要开火 不要开火!
APOLLO: Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

86
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,410
别动 妈的
MATHIAS: Stay, you frakkers!

87
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,830
我说了别开火!
I said hold your fire!

88
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,710
赐予我们...力量...智慧...
NO. 6:Grant us the strength, the wisdom.

89
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,760
他们在干什么呢?
APOLLO: What are they doing?

90
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,970
最重要的...承诺的量度
Above all, a measure...

91
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,930
嗨 雅典娜 你在干什么?  雅典娜!
Hey, Athena, what are you doing? Athena!

92
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,390
你在干什么?  雅典娜!
What are you doing? Athena!

93
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,480
赐予我们...力量...智慧...
Grant us the strength, the wisdom...

94
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,440
叛徒
Traitor.

95
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,610
拯救你自己吧
Save yourself.

96
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,740
从何说起?
From what?

97
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,370
离我们远点
Keep away from us.

98
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,450
这儿发生什么了?
What happened here?

99
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,710
一个信标 我们把它带上船了
NO. 6: The beacon, we brought it onboard.

100
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,550
它有病毒
It carried a disease.

101
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,720
我们被感染了
We're infected.

102
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,470
感染?
Infected?

103
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,510
噢 他妈的!
Son-of-a-bitch!

104
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,680
行了 行了 行了! 
Okay, okay, okay!

105
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,270
冷静下来!
Settle down, keep your heads!

106
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,060
看好门 看好门!
Watch the doorways! Get the doorways!

107
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,730
卡拉狄加  我是阿波罗  我们这儿有个状况
Galactica, Apollo. We have a situation down here.

108
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,070
那些赛昂人感染了一种病毒
The Cylons have been infected with a disease.

109
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,750
我们都暴露在这里了 我们都暴露在这里了
We have all been exposed. We've all been exposed.

110
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,850
他们登船后一定要执行隔离程序
COTTLE: They'll have to come aboard under quarantine procedures.

111
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,810
从机库里清理出一条路通到医务室 并要消毒
Clear a path from the hangar deck to sickbay and sterilize it,

112
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,230
而猛禽机跟随他们后面进来
and the Raptors after they're in.

113
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,900
就交给我处理
I'll handle that.

114
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,740
他们要隔离多长时间呢?
How long will they have to stay in quarantine?

115
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,150
在血检结果出来前  我也不知道要多长时间
I won't know that until I do the blood work.

116
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,610
可能几天或几星期  这是没法说的事情
Could be days, weeks, there's no way to tell.

117
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,990
你说他们是被那个信标感染的?
You said they picked up this disease from a beacon?

118
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,580
是赛昂人说的
According to the Cylons.

119
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,160
能得到病原体的话就好了
Always good to have the source of the pathogen.

120
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,000
你能把它给弄到卡拉狄加上吗?
Can you bring it aboard Galactica?

121
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,920
不 太危险了 要限制暴露的危险
No, too dangerous. I want to limit our exposure.

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,460
囚犯怎么样了?
What about the prisoners?

123
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,590
囚犯?
Prisoners?

124
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,590
他们体内的病毒要更高级一些
The disease is more advanced in their systems,

125
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,470
所以我有了点想法 看看接下来病情会如何发展
so it'll give me at least an idea of what to expect as it progresses.

126
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,930
而且等他们死后 就能知道我们的人能活多久了
And when they die, it'll tell me how long our people have to live.

127
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,180
有多少囚犯?
How many prisoners?

128
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,810
你抓到多少个?
How many you got?

129
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,480
阿波罗 这是卡拉狄加 第一次检查
HELO: Apollo, Galactica. Alpha check.

130
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,700
卡拉狄加 我们看到你们了 正在接近右舷机库
Galactica. We have you in visual range. Approaching starboard hangar.

131
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,700
阿波罗  那是什么?
HELO: Apollo, what was that?

132
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,000
基地之星释放出大量能量
GAETA: Massive energy discharge from the Baseship!

133
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,750
它爆炸了 长官
It exploded, sir.

134
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,880
阿波罗 这是卡拉狄加  你们大家都还好吧?
Apollo, Galactica. You all right out there?

135
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,960
嗯  没事  我们还在这儿
Yeah, affirmative. We're still here.

136
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,260
发生什么了?
What the hell happened?

137
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,430
基地之星爆炸了 一定是自毁
Baseship exploded. Must've self-destructed.

138
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,470
你们这些家伙真走运 能平安出来
You guys are lucky you got out when you did.

139
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,220
收到
Roger that.

140
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,340
我相信没什么问题
Nothing the matter, I trust?

141
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,840
我们有些问题
We have some questions.

142
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,920
为了背叛我们  你计划了多久   盖尤斯?
How long have you planned to betray us, Gaius?

143
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,890
有趣
Funny.

144
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,350
你当然是在开玩笑了
You're joking, of course.

145
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,270
你这是对你自己不负责任了
You're only making this harder on yourself.

146
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,110
等一等
Wait a minute.

147
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,200
我是非常非常合作的 自从我来了以后
I have been more than very accommodating since I arrived here.

148
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,110
我帮你们找到了莎伦的孩子
I helped you find Sharon's baby.

149
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,870
我还帮你们搞到了通往地球的地图
I've helped you with the map towards Earth.

150
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,830
我们知道信标的事情了 盖尤斯
We know about the beacon, Gaius.

151
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,750
你知道它在那儿的 你知道那里有致命的病毒
You knew it was out there. You knew it contained a deadly virus.

152
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,250
不 我不知道
No, I didn't. I didn't.

153
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,170
是卡拉狄加发明了那种病毒吗?
Was the virus created by Galactica?

154
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,210
自从你登船以后  你和他们联系过吗?
D'ANNA: Have you been in contact with them since you've been on onboard,

155
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,970
或者说 在那次新卡布里卡大撤退之前就开始计划了?
or did you plan this before the evacuation of New Caprica?

156
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,980
这是一个很大的误解
This is a most profound misunderstanding.

157
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,730
我和那个病毒或那个信标没一点关系
No. I had nothing to do with the virus or the beacon.

158
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,530
没错 我在基地之星上确实看到了它
Yes. Yes, I did discover it on the Baseship

159
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,070
我是应该把这个情况及时跟你们说的 但是我没有
and I should have told you about it sooner, and I didn't.

160
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,740
因为我想你们会把病毒和我…
Because I thought, you know, you'd try and link me, you know,

161
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,790
联系起来 事实也是如此
to the virus, which is what is going on right now.

162
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,410
我错了 那是个错误
I was wrong and it was a mistake,

163
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,370
我完全承认我有责任
and I fully admit my responsibility.

164
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,750
再也不会有这种事情了
It will never happen again,

165
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,710
并且我希望你们接受我最真诚的歉意
and I hope you accept my most, you know, my most humble apology.

166
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,350
我正在对那个道标的来历进行研究
On a brighter note, I have a working theory as to where this beacon may...

167
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,240
对不起 盖尤斯
I'm sorry, Gaius.

168
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,450
如果你告诉我们真相  事情会更简单些
Things would've been so much simpler had you only told the truth.

169
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,500
我们认为你知道更多的病毒信息 我们得找出来
We think you know more about this virus and we intend to find out.

170
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,060
放松 喝点东西吧
Relax, have a drink.

171
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,570
我办不到
I can't.

172
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,820
疼 疼
The pain, the pain...

173
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,040
都是在你脑里的 盖尤斯
It's all in your head, Gaius.

174
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,080
疼痛  快乐  那只是神经系统反馈给大脑的
Pain, pleasure, they're just neural impulses sent to the brain.

175
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,170
是你决定怎么去解读这些信息
You decide how to interpret them.

176
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,130
它们可以是愉快的或者不愉快的
They can be pleasant or unpleasant.

177
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,650
不  不 请别这样!
No! No, please!

178
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,780
求你们了!
Please! No!

179
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,800
我也想停下来了 盖尤斯
I want it to stop, Gaius.

180
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,130
我不想让你感受这种痛楚
I don't want you to feel this pain.

181
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,220
卡布里卡  你也不想  对吧?
And neither does Caprica. Do you?

182
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,800
是的
No.

183
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,100
我爱你
I love you.

184
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,400
你有什么感觉吗?
You feel anything yet?

185
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,280
是的 我感觉恶心  被你烦得恶心
Yeah. I feel sick. Sick of you bugging me.

186
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,370
你没有接触任何感染的尸体
You didn't touch any infected skin jobs.

187
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,330
不是我的错 是你们笨
It's not my fault you're clumsy.

188
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,080
你可以亲我感染了的屁股
You can kiss my infected ass.

189
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,540
很好 你可以亲它  但它没有被感染  我把血检结果带来了
Well, you can kiss it, but it's not infected. I got your blood work back.

190
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,960
人类对这种病毒是免疫的 你们都是健康的
Humans are immune to the virus. You're all healthy.

191
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,170
谢谢
Thank you.

192
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,090
好的 伙计们 干得好 让我们离开这里吧
All right, people, nice job. Let's get out of here.

193
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,630
让我们离开这里吧
PILOT: Come on, let's get out of here.

194
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,130
你不行 你要多待一段时间
No. You stay put for a while.

195
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,730
是
Yes!

196
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,230
不 不 不 不 请告诉我她没问题吧
No, no, no, no, no. Please. Tell me she's okay.

197
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,110
我还没做她的血检呢
I haven't done her blood work yet.

198
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,190
什么?
What?

199
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,780
我知道了 她可以等 因为她不是人
I see. She can wait because of who she isn't.

200
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,360
莎伦?
Sharon?

201
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,370
你会没事的 我保证
You're gonna be okay, I promise.

202
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,380
你是冲着我来的 该死的
You come for me, Gods damn it,

203
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,090
你这样做就是冲着我的 你知道的
you come for me the second you know.

204
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,760
把他带走 他快不行了
Take him. He's the furthest gone.

205
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,930
不 不 不
No! No! No.

206
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,690
你可以让赛昂人活下去?
ROSLIN: You can keep the Cylons alive?

207
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,690
我没把握治愈他们 不过没错…
I can't cure them, but yes.

208
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,190
多长时间?
How long?

209
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,700
还不确定
Indefinitely.

210
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,490
我识别出了病毒 我们把它叫做淋巴球性脑炎
I identified the virus. We know it as "Lymphocytic encephalitis. "

211
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,830
是啮齿目动物会得的病 多数是鼠科
The disease is carried by rodents, rats, mostly.

212
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,500
但几百年以前 人类对它有了免疫性
But a couple of hundred years ago, humans developed an immunity.

213
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,710
现在我也可以做出一个简单的疫苗
Now I can create a simple vaccine

214
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,590
可以把赛昂人体内病毒引起的病状明显改善
that will dramatically reverse the effect of the virus on the Cylons.

215
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,380
但是 他们的血液里有抗体
But they have an antibody in their blood 

216
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:38,090
会把疫苗的RNA给破坏
which breaks down the RNA of the vaccine.

217
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,818
那样它们就需要高频率、短间隙的注射疫苗
So they will need regular, close-interval injections

218
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:43,350
否则他们就会死
 of the vaccine or they will die.

219
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,890
我能问个难听的问题吗?
Can I ask the ugly question here?

220
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,890
能找出一个让它们继续活着的理由吗?
Is there any reason to keep them alive?

221
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,190
我们可以审问一些情报
We could interrogate them for intelligence.

222
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,740
我同意 我们有很多未解的疑问
I agree. We have a lot of unanswered questions.

223
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
那好 就这样        但它们不会说的
Yeah, okay, but they're not gonna talk.

224
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,410
我们给它们疫苗的时候它们就会说的
ROSLIN: Well, they might if we dangle the vaccine.

225
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,830
它们也没必要知道那只是短期有效 而不是痊愈药剂
They don't need to know it's a stopgap, not a cure.

226
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,080
它们在被感染的船上做了祷告
They prayed on the infected ship.

227
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,620
西洛的老婆说 那是个叫做 "什么什么云的祈祷"
Karl's wife said it was something called, "The Prayer to the Cloud of Unknowing,"

228
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,790
管他妈的是什么
whatever the hell that is.

229
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,250
总之 关键是她说 它们只会在面对
Anyway, the point is, she said they only use it

230
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,630
最终的死亡的时候
when they're facing an imminent death that is final,

231
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,760
没有重新下载的机会时
no possibility of downloading.

232
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,800
它们在准备面对死亡
They're ready to die.

233
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,050
他们可能是准备好要死了
They may be ready to die,

234
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,560
但是这并不意味着他们不会再跳起来
but it doesn't mean that one of them won't jump at a second chance.

235
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,910
它感染了所有的东西
It infected everything,

236
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:48,040
基地之星 赛昂武士 突袭机
the Baseship, Centurions, Raiders,

237
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:54,840
直到我们被别的赛昂人飞船彻底遗弃
and so we were finally abandoned by the other Cylon ships.

238
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,300
为什么?
Why?

239
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,680
为什么不把你们隔离起来直到找到治疗的方法?
Why not just put you under quarantine until they found a cure?

240
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,310
是怕病毒会扩散
Fear of spreading the disease.

241
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,020
他们告诉我们 在病原体的组成中
They told us that there was a bio-electric feedback component

242
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,070
有一个生物电反馈部分
to the pathogen.

243
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,610
它会破坏我们大脑对免疫系统的控制
It corrupts how our brains manage our immune systems.

244
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,700
如果我们死掉并被复活 病毒也会跟着
If one of us dies and is resurrected, the disease will follow,

245
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,840
感染复活船 还有舰队
infecting the Resurrection ship and the Fleet.

246
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,010
你们为什么会在这里首先出现?
Why were you in this area in the first place?

247
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,590
我们被派过来
We were sent.

248
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,430
我们被派到这儿来寻找狮子星云
We were sent here to look for the Lion nebula.

249
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,230
波塔尔说狮子星云会指出通往地球之路
Baltar said it would point the way to Earth.

250
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,730
你刚才说什么?
What did you just say?

251
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,480
波塔尔...波塔尔还活着?
Baltar... Baltar's alive?

252
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,940
波塔尔在我们的基地之星上
Baltar is on our Baseship.

253
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,410
他在帮我们寻找地球
He's helping us find Earth.

254
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:12,000
他在用我们的导航图 还有我们从科波上发现的地图
He's using our navigation charts along with our map of Kobol.

255
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,170
他在带它们找地球
He's leading them to Earth.

256
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:24,300
我们想要一个新的开始
We want a new beginning,

257
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,850
多像你们
much like you.

258
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,480
我告诉了你们信息
I gave you information.

259
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,610
她说会有解药
She said that there was a cure.

260
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,740
科特尔医生会给你药物的
Doc Cottle will be giving you the medicine.

261
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,280
把他带回医务室
Take him back to the infirmary.

262
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,820
是 长官
MARINE: Yes, sir.

263
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,850
这有什么好笑的?
What the hell is so funny?

264
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,530
我想我找到了一个方法 可以解决掉我们的麻烦
I think I just thought of a way to solve all of our problems,

265
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,200
可以把赛昂人的威胁一次性地全部消除
to get rid of the Cylon threat for once and for all.

266
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,200
我们可以把它们全部消灭 灭掉整个赛昂人种族
We can wipe them out. We can destroy the entire Cylon race.

267
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,170
我们可以跳跃到一个已知的赛昂人补给线地域
APOLLO: We jump to an area we know the Cylons use as a supply line,

268
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,930
星云坐标2539
NCD2539.

269
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,390
我们在那儿故意暴露 我们假装要向它们寻战
We stay there, exposed. We look as if we're spoiling for a fight.

270
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,020
它们会派出舰队
They'll send their fleet.

271
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,480
只要有舰队 那就肯定有复活船
And where there's a fleet, there's a Resurrection ship.

272
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,230
只要复活船在我们范围内
Now, once the Resurrection ship is within our reach,

273
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:04,480
我们处死这里受感染的囚犯 接着撤退
we execute our infected prisoners. We bug out.

274
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,900
被处死的囚犯就会在复活船下载
The executed prisoners download into the Resurrection ship

275
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,320
它们还带着病毒
and with them, the virus.

276
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,740
你肯定病毒能下载到它们新躯体里吗?
You're sure the virus will download to a new body?

277
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,580
是赛昂人自己肯定的
The Cylons are sure of it.

278
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,920
它们把自己的病号都留在那里等死 毫无挽救的希望
They left their wounded out here to die alone with no hope of being rescued,

279
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,580
还告诉我们想知道的东西
that tells me all I need to know.

280
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,500
只要病毒在复活船上
And once the virus is in the Resurrection ship,

281
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,840
它们就停不了了
there'll be no stopping it.

282
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,930
去救助的人就可以成为瘟疫的携带者
Rescuers become carriers of the plague.

283
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,970
赛昂人自己都不相信它们能找到治疗方法
The Cylons themselves don't believe that they'll develop a cure.

284
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,480
噢 我的天
My Gods.

285
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,940
这样就可以把赛昂人彻底消灭
This could be the end of the Cylons entirely.

286
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,900
永远的    屠杀?
Forever. Genocide?

287
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,530
那就是我们要做的?
So that's what we're about now?

288
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,860
它们不是人类 它们是被造出来的
They're not human. They were built, not born.

289
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,450
没有父亲 没有母亲 没有儿子 没有女儿
No fathers, no mothers, no sons, no daughters...

290
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,740
我有一个女儿 我还用我的胳膊抱过她
I had a daughter. I held her in my arms.

291
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,330
她是半人类
She was half human.

292
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,870
但它们是东西 是危险的东西
These are things, dangerous things.

293
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,670
这是我们一个消灭它们的机会
This is our one chance to be rid of them.

294
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,840
你可以说一些听起来合理的东西
You can rationalize it any way you want.

295
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,420
我们这么做 我们将它们灭族
We do this, we wipe out their race,

296
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,630
那么 我们就和他们没有什么区别了
then we're no different than they are.

297
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,140
上尉 我不认同你的看法
ROSLIN: Captain, I respectfully disagree.

298
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,220
是赛昂人首先发起攻击
The Cylons struck first in this war.

299
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,520
并且他们不满足于灭绝了数十亿的人类
And not being content with the annihilation of billions of human beings,

300
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,020
他们残酷地在星系间追逐我们
they've pursued us relentlessly through the galaxies,

301
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,270
想把我们全灭掉
determined to wipe us out.

302
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,060
他们试图在新卡布里卡上和我们共同生活
They tried to live with us on New Caprica.

303
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,190
你说什么?
What did you say?

304
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,730
他们试图在新卡布里卡上和我们共同生活
They tried to live with us on New Caprica.

305
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,280
你没在新卡布里卡待过 根据我的记忆 你没去过那里
You were not on New Caprica. To my recollection you didn't set foot there.

306
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,740
如此地不顾及你的几百名男女手下
So out of respect for the hundreds of men and women on your crew

307
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,740
在那个蛇窟里遭受的折磨
who suffered through that snake pit,

308
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,330
我希望没听到你刚才说的话
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

309
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,750
你能更好地为舰队服务  如果你能偶尔想想 
You would serve your fleet well if you would remember occasionally

310
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,090
对于幸存下的人类来说
that the Cylons are a mortal threat

311
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,500
赛昂人是个致命的威胁
to the survival of the human race.

312
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,840
我在说的是:对和错
I'm talking about right and wrong.

313
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,970
我在说的是:我们丧失了自身的一部分灵魂
I'm talking about losing a piece of our souls.

314
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,720
没人想听 对吗?  那就从我来说吧
But no one wants to hear that, right? Let's keep it on me.

315
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,440
没错 我是和一个赛昂人结婚
Yeah, I'm married to a Cylon

316
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,520
多少次 她为我们大家吃尽了苦头
who walked through hell for all of us how many times?

317
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,270
同时 她还不是那个什么半个东西
And she's not half anything.

318
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,940
我们怎么知道没有其他与她同样的人呢?
Okay, how do we know there aren't others like her?

319
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:15,910
她做出了决定 她要做个人 他们也是人
She made a choice. She's a person, they're a race of people.

320
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,080
用生化武器把他们灭族 那就是一个反…
Wiping them out with a biological weapon is a crime against...

321
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,790
就是一个反人类罪
Is a crime against humanity.

322
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,750
但它们不是人类 它们是程序设定好的
But they're not human. They're programmed.

323
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:33,220
我们会考虑你所说的话 谢谢你们两个
We will take your input under advisement. Thank you both.

324
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,050
谢谢 女士
Thank you, ma'am.

325
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,140
解散
Dismissed.

326
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,680
我可以帮你
I can help you.

327
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,180
我可以让你度过这折磨
I can guide you through the torment and beyond,

328
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,720
但你要做点事
but you'll have to do the work.

329
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,190
我会做任何事 任何事!
I'll do anything. Anything!

330
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,770
那就告诉我们想知道的
Then tell us what we want to know.

331
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:35,240
病毒是怎么创造出来的?  有治愈方法吗?
How was the virus invented? Did they make a cure?

332
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,080
看着我 看着我
Look at me. Look at me.

333
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,450
当你和我做爱的时候 盖尤斯
When you make love to me, Gaius,

334
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,870
你不是总想着我的
you don't always think about me.

335
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,460
你的思维漂走了 我知道的
Your mind wanders, I know that.

336
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,380
你会想到方程式、难题 你要烫洗的衣服
You think of equations, puzzles, your laundry...

337
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:58,970
那是大脑的本能 断开和身体的连接
It's the nature of the mind to disconnect from the body and journey on its own.

338
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,390
将你的思维与身体分离 把你的思维留在那个房间
Separate your mind from your body. Keep your mind in that room.

339
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,060
用你的智力来对付她
Use your intellect against her.

340
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,030
理由 逻辑 分析
Reason. Logic. Analysis.

341
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,400
寻找她心灵的漏洞
Find the holes in her psyche.

342
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,320
我不能啊 很疼
I can't. The pain...

343
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:24,080
疼痛只存在你的身体里 让你的身体与我在一起吧
The pain is only in your body, so keep your body here with me.

344
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,630
别担心 我会好好照顾它的
Don't worry, I'll care take of it.

345
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,010
你看 盖尤斯  这就是不疼的感觉
D'ANNA: You see, Gaius, this is what the absence of pain feels like.

346
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,690
很容易忘掉疼痛
It's easy to forget.

347
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:55,940
我和病毒没有关系 那只是个巧合
I had nothing to do with the virus. It was a coincidence.

348
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,320
没有巧合这个说法
There's no such thing as coincidence.

349
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,700
世界是按照上帝的旨意运作的
God wills the universe according to His design.

350
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:08,540
现在专注于她 把她当成赛昂人 而不是女人
Now focus on her as a Cylon, not a woman.

351
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,130
并以科学家的眼光 测试她的信念
Be a scientist. Examine her faith.

352
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,960
你的分析结果呢 博士?
What's your analysis, Doctor?

353
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,550
我是个科学家
I'm a scientist.

354
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,430
并且作为一个科学家
And as a scientist,

355
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,543
如果上帝存在 
I believe that if God exists, 

356
00:27:30,544 --> 00:27:33,100
那我们对他的了解是不完全的    为什么呢?
our knowledge of him is imperfect. Why?

357
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,320
因为我们现有的故事和神话
Because the stories and myths we have

358
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,030
是由人编撰出来的 人是时间的过客
are the products of men, the passage of time.

359
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,570
这种宗教是基于这么一个前提 无法被证明
The religion you practice is based on a theory, impossible to prove,

360
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,580
你现在完全地信任神话
yet you bestow it with absolutes like

361
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
就像"没有巧合这个说法"
"there is no such thing as coincidence. "

362
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,540
这叫信念
It's called faith.

363
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,710
对上帝意志的完全信仰就意味着万物的存在都有理由
Absolute belief in God's will means there's a reason for everything.

364
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,630
万物!
Everything!

365
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,170
还有现在...
And yet,

366
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:04,430
你不禁自问 上帝如何行使死亡与毁灭
you can't help ask yourself how God can allow death and destruction,

367
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,760
然后鄙视自己的疑问
and then despise yourself for asking.

368
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,840
但现实是 如果我们能知道上帝的旨意
But the truth is, if we knew God's will, 

369
00:28:08,841 --> 00:28:10,480
那我们就都是神了 不是吗?
we'd all be Gods, wouldn't we?

370
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,810
我可以从你的眼里看出 戴安娜
I can see it in your eyes, D'Anna.

371
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,560
你失落 你矛盾 让我来帮你吧
You're frustrated. You're conflicted. Let me help you.

372
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,940
让我来帮助你改变吧
Let me help you change,

373
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,740
找到一个...能让你的信仰与现实统一的办法
find a way to reconcile your faith with fact,

374
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,200
找到一条通往理性世界的道路
find a way towards a rational universe!

375
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,660
我不知道你在玩什么游戏
I don't know what your game is,

376
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,040
但那是没用的
but it's not going to work.

377
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,250
你故意把我们的一艘船引到那个信标那儿 是不是?
You intentionally led one of our ships to that beacon, didn't you?

378
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,800
把你的身体交给我 只把你的思维留下
Give your body to me. Only your mind is there.

379
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,890
感受我 感受这些而不管她给你的疼痛
Feel me. Feel this where she wants you to feel pain.

380
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,770
看着我 看着我 盖尤斯
Look at me. Look at me, Gaius.

381
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,230
你想让我相信你是值得被拯救的吗?
Do want me to believe you're worth saving?

382
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,650
你想吗? 你想吗? 说出来
Do you? Do you? Say it.

383
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,820
我想让你信任我
I want you to believe in me!

384
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,580
别停下! 别停下!
Don't stop. Don't stop!

385
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,210
请 请你别停下
Please! Please don't stop!

386
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,000
你一定会信任我的 你是我的全部
You have to believe in me, you're all I have left!

387
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,590
现在告诉我 你信任我
Now tell me you believe in me.

388
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,840
告诉我 你相信我的力量
Tell me you believe in my strength.

389
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:30,260
我信任你! 我信任你!
I believe in you! I believe in you.

390
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,180
我爱你
BALTAR: I love you.

391
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,230
我全心全意的爱你
I love you with all my heart.

392
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,950
我全心全意地爱你
I love you with all my heart.

393
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,230
怎么样?
How?

394
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,490
科特尔医生说与怀过半人类的小孩有关
Cottle said it had something to do with carrying a half-human child,

395
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,990
婴儿的血细胞进入到了母体的循环系统
how the fetal blood cells enter the maternal circulatory system,

396
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,080
让我也拥有了抗体 不管怎么样 我是免疫的
causing the mother to create antibodies, whatever. I'm immune!

397
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,160
噢 上帝啊
Oh, you.

398
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,470
我们的孩子救了我的命
Our baby saved my life.

399
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:54,510
她永远地走了 还救了我的命  赫拉与我们同在
She's gone forever and she saved my life. Hera kept us together.

400
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,390
分享这些
To share this.

401
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,270
这些?
"This"?

402
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,530
你说我们?  一起?  你说我们?
What, you mean us, together? You mean us?

403
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:09,490
他们  他们  我是说他们
Them, them. I mean them.

404
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,200
谁是"他们?"
Who's "them"?

405
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,630
他们准备处死被感染的囚犯
They're gonna execute the infected prisoners,

406
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:31,090
但要到跳跃进入赛昂人的地界
but not until we jump into a Cylon region,

407
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,890
在复活船范围内
with a Resurrection ship present.

408
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,230
那样就能感染到各处
The infection's gonna spread everywhere.

409
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,620
我想说一点
There's a point I'd like to make.

410
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,830
法律禁止我们使用生化武器
The law forbids me to use biological weapons

411
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,710
在没有总统命令的情况下
without a direct presidential order.

412
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,750
那意味着你要遇到麻烦了
Which means you're passing the buck.

413
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,550
在这件事上 是的
On this one, yes.

414
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,010
西洛在这件事上是对的
Helo's right on one thing.

415
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,770
我们在毁灭整个种族 哪怕它们是机器种族
We start destroying entire races, even mechanical races,

416
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:24,940
我们会遭受心灵的谴责
we're liable to tear off a piece of a man's soul.

417
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,020
赛昂人在寻找地球
The Cylons are coming to Earth.

418
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,240
如果它们找到我们 他们就会袭击我们
If they find us, they are coming for us.

419
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,950
它们都是木头脑袋 它们一直都是这样的 比尔
Those are the stakes. They always have been, Bill.

420
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,160
我们说的是你整个种族的屠杀
We're talking about the genocide of your entire race.

421
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:51,210
是的 你以为我不知道吗
Yeah. You think I don't know that?

422
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,720
我做了穿上这身制服的决定
I made a choice to wear a uniform.

423
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,890
来当个人
To be a person.

424
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,980
你在穿上这身制服前 就已经是人了
You were a person before you put on that uniform, okay?

425
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,150
你在与我相爱前就已经是个人了
You were a person before I fell in love with you.

426
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,480
你不需要证明这个
You don't have to prove that.

427
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,230
我每天都要证明
I have to prove it every day.

428
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,200
让我告诉你 西洛
Let me tell you something, Helo.

429
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:21,410
我们的人可能会死掉 整个族群可能会被灭掉
My people may die, my entire race may be wiped out,

430
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,380
但这个赛昂人会一直遵守她的诺言
but this Cylon will keep her word,

431
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,260
哪怕那意味着她是世界上唯一的赛昂人
even if it means she's the last Cylon left in the universe.

432
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,720
这是否有哪个人类能做到呢?
Can a human being do that?

433
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,360
我们的后代不会宽容我们的种族灭绝计划
Posterity really doesn't look too kindly on genocide.

434
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,490
你只是在假设我们的后代会把这定义为种族灭绝
You're making an assumption that posterity will define this as genocide.

435
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,780
如果他们这样想 至少他们还可以活着来憎恨我们
If they do, at least there'll be someone alive to hate us for it.

436
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,410
赛昂人的产生是我们的错误 我们创造了他们
The Cylons are our mistake, we created them.

437
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,920
好吧 阿达玛上将
All right, Admiral Adama,

438
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,380
作为总统  我决定赛昂人要被消灭
as President, I have determined the Cylons be made extinct.

439
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,800
生化武器的使用已被授权
The use of biological weapons is authorized.

440
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,890
齐心协力
So say we all.

441
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,640
齐心协力
So say we all.

442
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,570
跳跃完毕 雷达上显示没有赛昂人 长官
Jump complete. Dradis is clear, no Cylons, sir.

443
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,160
它们一会儿就会来的 让我们的"小鸟"上天吧
They'll be here soon enough. Get our birds in the air.

444
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,000
命令蝮蛇战机与导航侦察猛禽机升空
Commence Viper and nav Raptor launch.

445
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,670
又是那里 关了它 走吧
CREWMAN: Once more there! Let's get it closed. Let's go!

446
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,130
我们干吧  赛道
Let's do this, Racetrack.

447
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,670
行动 行动
CREWMAN 1: Let's go, let's go, let's go!

448
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,840
准备发射道
CREWMAN 2: Prepare the tubes!

449
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,840
旋压向上
CREWMAN 3: Spinning up.

450
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,510
准备好了
CREWMAN 4: All up!

451
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,250
行动 行动 把那些挪走
Let's go! Let's go! Move them back!

452
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,550
快行动 快行动!跟上!
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

453
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,140
CAP编队升空  导航机已在雷达上看到
Cap is away. Nav Bird has them on Dradis.

454
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,830
雷达发现目标 一队赛昂人突袭机
Dradis contact. Pair of Cylon Raiders.

455
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,330
和它们保持距离
Keeping their distance for now.

456
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:15,290
不要花太长时间 它们只是侦查机
Didn't take them that long. It's just scouts.

457
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,550
它们会跳跃走  向舰队报告
They'll jump away and report back to their fleet.

458
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,920
来看我们有没有什么圈套的
See if they take our bait.

459
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:28,390
发现它们了 它们中有一艘复活船
Got it. There's a Resurrection ship with them.

460
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:32,940
是对我们的赛昂人囚犯执行死刑的时候了 下命令
Then it's time to execute our Cylon prisoners. Call it in.

461
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,320
处死囚犯
Terminate the prisoners.

462
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,120
射击头部 好吗?
Head shots, okay?

463
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,240
是 长官
Yes, sir.

464
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,950
让我们搞定
Let's do it.

465
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,880
好了 让我们看看能否干掉些烤面包机 伙计们
Let's see if we can't frak up some toasters on this joyride, people.

466
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,220
大家一起加油  我在上面感觉要死哦
HOTDOG: Bogies holding hands, I'm notching like hell up here!

467
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,930
热狗 我是星芭
Hot Dog, Starbuck.

468
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,980
闭上你的臭嘴 继续掩护我们
Quit your bitching and continue to cover us, frak!

469
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,700
好 让开
All right, out of the way.

470
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,920
妈的! 它们全死了  它们都死了
Frak! They're already dead. They're already dead.

471
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,550
长官 你应该听下这个
Sir, you should hear this.

472
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,100
它们在复活船出现前都死了
APOLLO: They were dead before the Resurrection ship was in range.

473
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,230
它们没有下载病毒 我们失去机会了
They didn't download the disease. We have missed our window.

474
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,980
卡拉狄加  星芭  基地之星刚跳跃过来
Galactica, Starbuck. The Baseship just jumped in.

475
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,190
招回我们的"小鸟"  撤离
Call our birds in. Spool up.

476
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,610
让我们离开这鬼地方
Let's get the hell out of here.

477
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,950
执行命令 西奥       是 长官
Commence it, Theo! Yes, sir!

478
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,740
长官 我们没机会听好消息了
Sir, we've lost time waiting to hear from quarantine.

479
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,370
我们想好好打一仗的在我们撤退的时候
We're going to take significant fire while we spool up.

480
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,960
等等
Wait a minute.

481
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,050
继续跳跃
Continue jump.

482
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,090
让我们回舰队去
Take us back to our fleet.

483
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,220
是 长官
Yes, sir.

484
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,110
他们会来找我麻烦的 你或是我
They're coming for me. You or me.

485
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,780
看起来他们会经常找我们之一的麻烦
It seems like they're always coming for one of us.

486
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:01,080
我不是个叛徒 我爱我的人民 我爱这艘船
I'm not a traitor. I love my people, I love this ship.

487
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,260
除了你 我在早上最想能看到的就是作战指挥中心里的灯光
Besides you, the first I want to see on any morning are the lights in that CIC.

488
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,140
我做了我认为是对的事
But I did what I thought was right.

489
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,770
如果那是个错误 也行 我可以承受
If it was a mistake, fine, I can live with that.

490
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,240
但是没有你 我活不下去
It's you I can't live without.

491
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,250
我会永远爱你 西洛
I'll always love you, Helo.

492
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,970
不了  谢谢
No, thanks.

493
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,320
囚犯是因为窒息而死的
The prisoners died of asphyxiation.

494
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,410
空气净化系统被关闭 以伪装空气都跑光了
The air purification system was reversed. Sucked the oxygen out.

495
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:18,120
这时候 门上的保险拴
When this happens, the dead bolts

496
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,660
就会自动激活
are automatically activated on the door.

497
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,040
是有人动的手脚
Someone did this manually.

498
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,170
有人?
Someone?

499
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,670
在我看来 只有一两个嫌疑人
Seems to me there's only one or two likely suspects.

500
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,550
谁负责调查呢?
Who will head the investigation?

501
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,760
没人 我把这件事封锁了
No one. I'm closing the book on this.

502
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,600
多省心的决定啊
How convenient.

503
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:51,240
科特尔医生关于病毒的报告
Cottle's report on the virus.

504
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,570
他认为那个被我们丢在赛昂飞船上的道标
He thinks that it was simply an accidental contamination

505
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:01,500
被病毒污染只是个意外
of the beacon we abandoned on the sickbay ship.

506
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,710
可能是有人打了喷嚏造成的?
Somebody sneezed, maybe?

507
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:07,210
是啊 因为有人忘了擦干自己的鼻子
Yeah, an entire race almost wiped out

508
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,500
差点就能灭掉一整个种族
because someone forgot to wipe their nose.

509
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:25,640
根据科特尔所说 这个病毒非常符合
According to Cottle, the virus was an exact match

510
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:29,690
一个3000多年前被报告的病毒
to one reported over 3,000 years ago,

511
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,360
大概在那个时候 我们的第13部落离开了科波
right around the time that the Thirteenth Colony left Kobol.

512
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,410
那个信标是去地球的一个路标
That beacon was a signpost to Earth.

513
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,120
我们找对路了 劳拉
I think we're on the right trail, Laura.

514
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,620
是的 我们找对路了 比尔
Yes, we are on the right trail, Bill.

515
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,130
赛昂人也找对了
So are the Cylons.
