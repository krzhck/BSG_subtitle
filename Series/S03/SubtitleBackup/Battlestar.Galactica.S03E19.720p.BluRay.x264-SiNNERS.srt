1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,630
太空堡垒卡拉狄加 【 前情提要 】
TIGH: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,750
赛昂人组建了一支人类警察部队
ROSLIN: The Cylons have established a human police force.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,180
我们的几百名同胞被赛昂人集中在一起
Hundreds of us have been rounded up by the Cylons,

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,800
关押 审问 蹂躏
held in detention, questioned, tortured.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,430
这是什么?
What's this?

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,970
这是一份对所有犯人的处决书
This orders the summary executions

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,890
他们的名字都在下一页
of all the detainees listed on the next page.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,100
需要你的签名
It requires your signature.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,980
签字!  签上你的名字!
Sign it! Sign your name!

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,910
赛昂人对我们的动向了如指掌
The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.

11
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,250
听我解释
I want to explain.

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,790
她出卖了我们
SAM: She sold us out.

13
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,210
你知道该怎么做了吧
You know what has to be done here.

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,460
为了她好  还是由你来亲自动手
Now, it would be better for her sake if it was you.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,630
你不怕代表这个十恶不赦的人出庭?
You're not afraid to represent the most hated man alive?

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,300
我想见一下我的委托人
I'd like to see my client.

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,390
如果他们要害我  他们自有办法
If they want to kill me, they'll find a way.

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,510
不!
No!

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,270
波塔尔的律师这一受伤  他的辩方会需要人手
With Baltar's lawyer injured, his defense will need help.

20
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,390
爸  我为什么不行?  我了解这个案子 看过相关文件
Dad, why not me? I'm close to the case, I've read the documents.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,020
你是空军队长 不是律师
You're a CAG, you're not a lawyer.

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,070
我不会让你坐在法庭的另一端
I will not allow you to sit across the courtroom

23
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,030
来为波塔尔辩护
on the other side, defending Gaius Baltar.

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,900
这是命令吗?
Is that an order?

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,320
我不会再对你下命令了
I'm through giving you orders.

26
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,480
赫拉?
Hera?

27
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,160
赫拉!
Hera!

28
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,570
绿叶号的超光速引擎终于修好了  长官
We finally got Greenleaf's FTL nailed down, sir.

29
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,820
舰队又可以起程了
So, fleet's ready to jump again.

30
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,700
还有多少次跳跃我们才能找到那座星云?
How many more before we find the nebula?

31
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,790
我估计十二次 快了
I'm estimating an even dozen. We're getting close.

32
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,920
还是不见赛昂人的踪影?
Still no sign of the Cylons?

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,840
是的  长官  在每个跳跃点 我们都留下了一架断后机
No, sir. We've left a trailing bird in every jump site.

34
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,750
未发现目标 没有目击  什么都没有
No dradis contacts, no sighting, nothing.

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,380
更改断后猛禽机的命令
Alter the mission orders of the trailing Raptor.

36
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,510
告诉他们在返回舰队之前 
Tell them to remain an additional six hours

37
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,350
再留守六小时
before catching up with the fleet.

38
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,600
是  长官
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,650
好
Yeah!

40
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,910
到你了  大明星
You're up, superstar!

41
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,750
你们知道这场比赛可他妈是动真格的吧?
You know this game's got frak-all to do with the real thing, right?

42
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,500
你们这群菜鸟在开始的时候可没那么说
SKULLS: Yeah. I didn't hear you nuggets say that at the beginning.

43
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,560
我可不管别人…
I don't really care what anybody...

44
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,430
好  往回调一下 就差一点
There, go back, you almost had it.

45
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,060
什么差一点?
SEELIX: Had what?

46
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,650
那首歌  你没听到么?
That song. You don't hear that song?

47
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,860
没有啊  来吧  到你了 走啦
No. Come on, you're up, let's go.

48
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,780
好吧  好吧
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,820
波塔尔曾协助赛昂人袭击殖民地
Baltar was instrumental in the Cylon attack on the Colonies.

50
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,160
总统要以种族灭绝的罪名控告他
The President wants him charged with genocide.

51
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,580
这我可无法认同 并没有证据显示他参与了…
I can't make it stick. There is no evidence of his involvement...

52
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,000
总统曾见过他与卡布里卡上的一名六号在一起
The President saw him with one of the Sixes on Caprica,

53
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,960
在那次袭击之前
before the attacks.

54
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,050
你真想把劳拉・罗丝琳推上证人席 
You really want me to put Laura Roslin

55
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,260
来为她的药源性幻觉申辩吗?
on the stand to testify about her drug-induced visions?

56
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,600
我们只想让你做好本职工作 判处他有罪
What we want is for you to do your job and convict him.

57
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,720
如果你做不到 我们可以找其他人
You can't do that, we'll find someone who will.

58
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,680
我们这是以礼相见 可不是战术讨论会
This a courtesy meeting, not a strategy session.

59
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,480
我会秉公办事
I am charging Baltar with what I can prove.

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,650
当然 我也会讨总统的欢心
Of course, I do serve at the pleasure of the President

61
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,610
还有如果她决定找人替代我
and if she decides to replace me,

62
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,690
我确信其他律师也都愿意接手这个案子
I'm sure there are other lawyers willing to take up the case.

63
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,870
如果还有律师的话
If there are any other lawyers.

64
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,090
波塔尔博士?
Doctor Baltar?

65
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,760
你是哪位?
Who are you?

66
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,470
哦
Oh.

67
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,690
很抱歉 我的律师一再强调
Look, I'm terribly sorry, I'm under strict instructions from my attorney

68
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,310
不要与任何媒体说话
not to speak to any members of the press.

69
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,110
不  波塔尔博士  我…
No, Doctor Baltar, I...

70
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,490
我想请您看一下这张照片
I want you to look at this picture.

71
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,150
这是我的儿子
This is my son.

72
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,820
他病了 我想请您保佑他
He's sick and I want you to bless him.

73
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,240
保佑他?
Bless him?

74
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,830
守卫!
Guard!

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,000
求你了      很抱歉  我帮不了你
Please! I'm terribly sorry, but I can't help you.

76
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,010
我不是神仙 或是什么神灵
I'm not God, the God or a god of any derivation thereof.

77
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,010
求求您        我保佑不了他 对不起
Please, I... I can't bless him, I'm sorry.

78
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,510
我又并没什么特异功能     我信您
I don't have any special powers. I believe in you.

79
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,220
不敢当      这地方是怎么了?
That's very flattering. What the hell's going on here?

80
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,680
都成动物园了
This place is becoming like a zoo.

81
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,850
我在受审中 我想单独呆会
I'm on trial for my life, I need a bit of privacy.

82
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,680
为他祈祷吧 求你了
Just pray for him, please.

83
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,020
求求您               该走了
Please. GUARD: Time to go.

84
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
我尽力而为    您可以救他
I'll do my best. You can save him.

85
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,610
还是留意点你自己吧
Yeah, mind how you go, now.

86
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,790
几个了?
How many is that now?

87
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,710
五个
Five.

88
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,960
还不算30  40个写了信的人
Not including the 30 or 40 who've written letters.

89
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,300
这是免不了的事
Well, I suppose it can't be helped.

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,970
名人受审经常能把疯子引来
Celebrity trials invariably bring out the crazies.

91
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,890
你认为他们都疯了?
So you think they're crazy?

92
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,650
我看到的是一个痛苦的女人
You see, I saw a woman in pain.

93
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,530
我看到的是一个比你还要了解你自己的女人
I saw a woman who can see you more clearly than you can see yourself.

94
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,990
即使他们杀了你 你的名字也会名垂千史
Even if they kill you, your name will live on forever.

95
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,930
卡拉狄加  我是猛禽289号机
RACETRACK: Galactica, Raptor 289.

96
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,760
我们已就位 准备展开断后任务
We're clear and in position for rear guard picket.

97
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,770
收到  289号  老实呆着 替我们把风
SKULLS: Roger, two-eight-niner. Have fun watching our ass, Racetrack.

98
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,270
老实看着波塔尔受审
Have fun watching Baltar's ass get nailed.

99
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,500
好  坐稳了  12小时倒计时
All right, get comfortable. 12 hours and counting.

100
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,290
我们像是钓钩上的诱饵 
Twelve hours hanging out here like bait on a hook,

101
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,300
要在这里等上12小时 查探赛昂人是否还在追踪咱们
waiting to see if the Cylons are still following us.

102
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,550
少说两句  发牌吧
Just shut up and deal, okay?

103
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,890
我们如何评估损失?
How do we measure loss?

104
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,190
如何评估损失?
How do we measure loss?

105
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,370
我们以死者的面孔来评估它
We measure it in the faces of the dead,

106
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,660
那些萦绕于我们记忆之中与梦境之中的面孔
the faces that haunt our memories and our dreams.

107
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,330
我们如何评估损失?
How do we measure loss?

108
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,840
我们以自己的面孔来评估它
We measure it in our own faces,

109
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,010
我们每天都能在镜中看到的面孔
the ones we see in the mirror every day

110
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,430
因为它是我们每个人的标记
because it has marked each of us.

111
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,560
那我们如何评估损失?
So, how do we measure loss

112
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,770
当采用其他方法
when the scale of it becomes

113
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,980
已经无法衡量它的时候
too hard to absorb any other way?

114
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,690
我们使用数字
We use numbers.

115
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,230
多少人遇害 多少人受伤
How many killed? How many maimed?

116
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,740
多少人失踪
How many missing?

117
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,860
而当那些数字如同两年前一样
And when those numbers become too vast to comprehend,

118
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,030
过于庞大不便理解的时候
as they did two years ago,

119
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,950
我们只好反其道而行之
we had to turn it around.

120
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,460
我们开始计算活人的数目
We began to count the living,

121
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,420
我们之中那些幸存下来...
those of us who survived

122
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,380
继续谱写人类传奇的人
to continue the saga of the human race.

123
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,300
44035人
44,035.

124
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,770
曾定居在新卡布里卡上的...
The sum total of survivors from the Twelve Colonies

125
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,900
将盖尤斯・波塔尔总统奉为领袖与保护者的
who settled on New Caprica with President Gaius Baltar

126
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,150
12殖民地的幸存者数目
as their leader and protector.

127
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,320
是38838人
38,838.

128
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,820
这我们脱离苦海那一天的人数
Our number the day after we escaped.

129
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,500
而缺失的数目呢 在座各位都不愿面对的数字
And the missing number, the one that no one wants to face.

130
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,890
是5179人
5,197.

131
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,190
我们中的5197名同胞
5,197 of us

132
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,820
遇害 掉队 或是就此消失
killed, left behind or simply disappeared.

133
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,280
所有剩余人类中的
5,197

134
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,530
5197人...
of all that remains of the human race,

135
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,700
不见了
lost!

136
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,960
12殖民地的民众把他们的命运...
The citizens of the Twelve Colonies

137
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,710
与性命寄托在盖尤斯・波塔尔身上
entrusted their fate and their lives to Gaius Baltar.

138
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,343
而我们所得到的回报
What we received was a reign 

139
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:40,300
却是令我们心灰意冷的恐怖统治
of terror that staggers our mind and breaks our hearts.

140
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,970
我们得到的不是统治 而是专制
Instead of governance, we got tyranny.

141
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,520
不是公正  而是压迫
Instead of justice, we got oppression.

142
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,730
不是总统  而是凶手
Instead of a president, we got a murderer.

143
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,730
今天 人类将让他承担他的罪责
Today, humanity holds him accountable for his crime.

144
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,820
盖尤斯・波塔尔不是受害者
Gaius Baltar is not a victim.

145
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,870
盖尤斯・波塔尔选择与赛昂人为伍
Gaius Baltar chose to side with the Cylons

146
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,410
主动迫害他的子民
and to actively seek the deaths of his fellow citizens.

147
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,170
就此而言...
For that...

148
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,630
他必须为此付出最终代价
He must pay the ultimate price.

149
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,310
法官大人 辩方请求被判为有罪
Your Honors, the defense would like to change our plea to guilty.

150
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,270
什么?
What?

151
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,270
律师  你确定要这么做吗?
Counselor, are you sure you want to do that?

152
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,610
不 可我有选择的余地么?
No, but what choice do I have?

153
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,280
我的委托人显然有罪
I mean, it's obvious my client is guilty.

154
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,070
他是个叛徒 是个杀人犯
He's a traitor and a killer.

155
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,660
他与赛昂人是一丘之貉 我们该怎么处置他?
He's no better than the Cylon, and what do we do with them?

156
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,910
把他扔出过渡舱!      对!
MAN: Throw them out the airlock! That's right!

157
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,790
把他扔出过渡舱!
Throw them out the airlock!

158
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,830
这小子把我们出卖给了敌人
This man sold us to our enemy.

159
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,510
这小子就是我们的敌人
This man is our enemy.

160
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,550
如果战争有一个好处 有一件事是正确 正当  正义的
And if there's one thing that's good in war, that is right and just and proper,

161
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,800
就是屠杀我们的敌人!
it's slaughtering our enemy!

162
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,140
报仇血恨!
Getting some righteous payback!

163
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,810
我们还等什么?!
What are we waiting for?

164
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
我们现在就杀了他!
Let's just kill him now!

165
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,990
这样不就省事多了么?
It'd be easier, wouldn't it?

166
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,490
简单多了
Simpler.

167
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,000
冤冤相报
Justice of the mob.

168
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,830
他们就想这样
It's what they want.

169
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,380
尤其是她
Especially her.

170
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,760
她等这一天已经一年有余
She's been wanting this for over a year now.

171
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,520
自从他在那场自由 公平的选举中挫败她那一刻开始
Ever since he beat her in a free and fair election of the people.

172
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,890
现在她终于有了一雪前耻的机会
Now she gets a chance to exact her revenge

173
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,440
而这个人的唯一罪行  仅仅是听天由命
upon a man whose only real crime is bowing to the inevitable.

174
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,200
盖尤斯・波塔尔 挽救了新卡布里卡上民众的生命
Gaius Baltar saved the lives of the people on New Caprica,

175
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,370
而劳拉・罗丝琳会把我们都害死
where Laura Roslin would have seen us all dead,

176
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,910
作为一场战争的受害者 我们没有赢的希望
victims of a battle we had no hope in winning.

177
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,590
我不知道诸位做何感想?
I don't know about you,

178
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,260
但当赛昂人从天而降说道缴枪不杀的时候
but I'm glad she wasn't the president when the Cylons arrived and said,

179
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,090
我很庆幸她不是总统
"Surrender or die. "

180
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,430
盖尤斯・波塔尔和他那天所做的决定救我一命
I owe my life to Gaius Baltar and the decision he made that day.

181
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,390
也包括劳拉・罗丝琳
So does Laura Roslin.

182
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,160
得了吧  好象你真知道似的
Yeah, like you frakking know.

183
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,580
我知道你在自己床上打手枪
I know you wank it in your rack.

184
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,290
帅哥
Ladies' man...

185
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,870
这叫自我疗法
You see, that's called self-healing.

186
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,500
好  检查时间
Okay, time check.

187
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,710
有情况
Oh, we got something.

188
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,130
好多敌人
Lots of company.

189
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,720
探测到三  四  五艘母舰  糟糕 他们就在我们的正上方
Reading three, four, no, five Baseships. Crap! They're right on top of us.

190
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,350
干 干 炮火来袭
Frak. Frak! Incoming!

191
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,850
超光速引擎仍在加速
The FTL's still spinning up.

192
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,520
我们得跳跃了
We've got to jump.

193
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,440
天杀的!  立即跳跃!
Now, Gods damn it. Now!

194
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,540
开始在整个舰队里搜索跟踪装置
Begin searching the entire fleet for tracking devices.

195
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,090
可能在新卡布里卡上的时候 它们就已被安置好了
It's possible they could have placed one on a ship on New Caprica.

196
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,430
我认为我们应该去问一下六号 她也许愿意提供帮助
I think that we should ask the Six. She may be willing to help.

197
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,220
波塔尔的女友 她为什么要那么做?
Baltar's girlfriend? Why would she do that?

198
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,850
因为她不想看到 赫拉落到赛昂人手中
Because she doesn't want to see Hera go back to the Cylons.

199
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,770
你认为那东西会为一个半赛昂人的崽子甘愿冒险?
You think that thing would stick her neck out for some half-Cylon whelp?

200
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,860
我有一种感觉  她愿以生命为代价
I have a feeling she'd lay her life down for it.

201
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,320
一种感觉?
A feeling?

202
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,160
不只是感觉  行了吧?    为什么…  就这么做吧
It's more than a feeling, all right? Why... Just do it.

203
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,990
问一下又有何妨
It doesn't hurt to ask.

204
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,370
对
No.

205
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,000
问一下犯人 她是否知道舰队里有任何跟踪装置
Ask the prisoner if it knows of any tracking devices in the fleet.

206
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,630
荣幸至致
With pleasure.

207
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,470
总统大人 老天保佑她活泼乐观的灵魂
The President, Gods bless her sunny optimistic soul,

208
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,760
认为你或许愿意透漏你的兄弟姐妹是如何跟踪我们的
thinks you might want to share how your buddies have been tracking us.

209
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,720
所以我来这里提出问题  听你说谎
So I'm here to ask the question and listen to your lies.

210
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,360
在上一次战斗中 我们发现了你们的燃料船…
In the last battle, we discovered your fuel ship

211
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,530
具有独特的辐射信号
had a unique radiation signature.

212
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,910
他们必定是找到了跟踪它的方法
They must have found a way to track it.

213
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,210
你还知道些什么?
What else do you know?

214
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,590
你那机器脑袋里还蕴藏着什么秘密?
What other secrets are rattling around inside that mechanical brain?

215
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
别怕他
Don't be intimidated by him.

216
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,640
他只是利用你来驱除他自身的苦痛
He's just using you to exorcise his own pain.

217
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,100
可怜的家伙
Poor old sod.

218
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,390
他失去了一个亲人
He lost someone close to him.

219
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,060
你了解这种感受  不是么?
But you know how that feels, don't you?

220
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,730
我知道很多事 有一件事你想知道么?
I know a lot of things. You want to know one thing I know?

221
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,110
我知道你的损失
I know about your loss.

222
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,280
心疼  是吧?
It hurts, doesn't it?

223
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,040
你都不知道自己是怎么坚持过来的
You wonder how you can even survive it.

224
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,880
我不明白你居心何在
I don't know what you're talking about,

225
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,880
可这没有用
but it's not gonna work.

226
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,710
她是他的全部
BALTAR: She was his world.

227
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,800
当然  到失去她之后他才知道
Of course, he only realized when she was gone.

228
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,390
她知道么?
Did she know?

229
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,060
她知道么?
Did she know?

230
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,890
她知道她对你有多重要么?
Did she know how much she meant to you?

231
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,810
还是直到她走了  你也没说出口?
Or did you wait to tell her till she was gone?

232
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,860
什么?
What?

233
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,070
你却让她以为自己是个累赘
Bet you made her think that she was a burden,

234
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,410
一个束缚你的枷锁
a millstone around your neck.

235
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:07,460
你们人类总是去毁灭爱你们的人 不是吗
But then you humans always destroy the ones who love you, don't you?

236
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,430
把这东西铐起来
Shackle this thing.

237
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,280
泰上校
CASSIDY: Colonel Tigh.

238
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,070
泰上校
Colonel Tigh.

239
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,620
抱歉 是什么问题来着?
Excuse me. What was the question again?

240
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,580
作为起义军领袖  
As the leader of the insurgency, did you ever hear of an instance

241
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,750
你是否听说过波塔尔反抗赛昂人
in which Baltar stood up to the Cylons

242
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,460
或试图破坏他们的计划?      没  从没听过 
or tried to disrupt their plans? Oh, no, never.

243
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,510
他从没出手帮助过我们
He never lifted a frakking finger to help us.

244
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,300
艾伦比他强
Ellen did more.

245
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,060
至少她在帮我们
At least she was trying to help us.

246
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,970
我的天  他喝多了
Oh, my Gods, he's drunk.

247
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,480
对
Yes.

248
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,020
对  艾伦  你的夫人
Yes, Ellen, your wife.

249
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,200
波塔尔赛昂同盟的又一位受害者
Another victim of Baltar's Cylon allies.

250
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,070
对  不错
Yeah, that's right.

251
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,950
谢谢  上校
Thank you, Colonel.

252
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,580
该你来讯问证人了
Your witness.

253
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,090
上校的太太出了什么事?
What happened to the Colonel's wife?

254
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,670
她曾为一个赛昂管理员工作
She used to work for one of the Cylon administrators.

255
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,340
为他们卖命? 
She worked for him?

256
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,510
你知道她出了什么事吗?
You know what happened to her?

257
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,180
不  不知道   我猜她在逃离新卡布里卡的时候死了
No, no idea. I presume she died in the exodus from New Caprica.

258
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
呃
Uh...

259
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,810
上校
Colonel.

260
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,610
你不喜欢盖尤斯・波塔尔
You dislike Gaius Baltar

261
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,740
是因为你认为他是个叛徒  对吗?
because you consider him to be a traitor. Is that correct?

262
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,570
还是个孬种  大屠杀的罪魁祸首
And a coward and a mass murderer.

263
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,830
警卫毕业典礼上的自杀式炸弹袭击
The suicide bombing of the police graduation.

264
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,580
盖尤斯・波塔尔才是预期目标  对吧?
Gaius Baltar was the intended target, was he not?

265
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,130
如果他那天有胆量到场
And if he'd had the guts to show up that day like he was supposed to,

266
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,300
你我现在说这些话都是多余
you and I wouldn't be having this conversation right now.

267
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,090
所以只为了有除掉 
So you ordered the killing of...

268
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,380
盖尤斯・波塔尔的机会
What was it, 33 other men and women?

269
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,350
你就下令杀死其他33人
Just for the chance to kill Gaius Baltar.

270
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,140
他们都是叛徒
They were all traitors.

271
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,350
只要是穿上那身制服的人
Anyone who put on that uniform.

272
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,270
不过是的 目标是他
But, yes, he was the target.

273
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,940
你的夫人出了什么事?
What happened to your wife?

274
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,070
反对 与本案有关系么?
Exception. Relevance?

275
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,240
我只是就势而上 法官大人
The door was opened on direct, Your Honor.

276
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,080
我看不出追问此事…
I fail to see the point of pursuing the subject.

277
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,580
他说得对  上将
He's right, Admiral.

278
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,870
如果已经在初步讯问提到过 
If it was brought up during direct examination,

279
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,790
他就可以继续追问
then it can be pursued in the cross.

280
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,670
反对无效  继续
Overruled. Continue.

281
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,920
你的夫人出了什么事  上校?
What happened to your wife, Colonel?

282
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,090
你他娘的狗杂种…
You frakking son of a bitch...

283
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,840
她与赛昂人公开勾结是真的吗?
Isn't it true that she collaborated openly with the Cylons?

284
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,300
确切地说  是为他们卖命?
That she actually worked for them?

285
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,060
她假装的
She was faking it.

286
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,060
使他们以为  她在为他们工作
Making them think that she was working for them.

287
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,520
我明白了 波塔尔可没有在伪装
I see, yeah. And Baltar, he wasn't faking it, no?

288
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,110
对
That's right.

289
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,860
你把她的死怪罪到了他的身上  上校 你今天喝酒了么?
And you blame him for her death. Have you been drinking today, Colonel?

290
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,040
喝了一杯 好久没喝了
I had a drink. I haven't been drinking.

291
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,210
我猜你从前喜欢和艾伦在一起喝酒吧
You used to like to drink with Ellen, I imagine.

292
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,050
你们听到了吗?
Do you hear that?

293
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,810
他们正在这里放音乐吗?
They're playing music in here now?

294
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,140
他在胡扯些什么?
What the hell is he talking about?

295
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,520
盖尤斯・波塔尔并没有下令处决你的夫人
LAMPKIN: Gaius Baltar didn't order the death of your wife.

296
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,240
上校  此事另有其人吧
Colonel, that was somebody else.

297
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,660
对吗  上校?
Who was it, Colonel?

298
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,450
谁害死了艾伦?
Who killed Ellen?

299
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,540
说吧  上校  大家都在等着 
Come on, Colonel, we're waiting.

300
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,000
告诉我们吧
Tell us.

301
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,800
谁?  是谁害死了艾伦?
Who was it? Who killed Ellen?

302
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,590
我
I did!

303
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,100
是我
I did.

304
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,600
是我干的
I did.

305
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,230
她把情报泄露给了赛昂人
She was giving information to the Cylons.

306
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,030
许多好人为此牺牲
A lot of good men died.

307
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,950
她是我的太太  应该由我负责
She was my wife. It was my responsibility.

308
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,240
她这么做是为了我  这是她说的
She did it for me. That's what she said.

309
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,460
为了让我免受牢狱之灾  再受皮肉之苦
To save me from going back to prison so they could tear more pieces off me.

310
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,380
所以我杀了她
So I killed her.

311
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,670
这一切全因为那边那个东西
All because of that thing over there.

312
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,630
全因为他娘的盖尤斯・波塔尔
All because Gaius frakking Baltar

313
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,930
没胆量与赛昂人抗争
didn't have the guts to stand up to the Cylons.

314
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,140
因为他把我们的命运交付给了赛昂人
Because he handed our fates over to the Cylons,

315
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,440
我只好杀死了我的艾伦
I had to kill my Ellen.

316
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,860
即是盖尤斯・波塔尔 促使你杀害了你的夫人
So, Gaius Baltar made you kill your wife.

317
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,160
这也是你恨他的原因
That's why you hate him.

318
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,740
因此只要能置他于死地  你什么都会说
And that's why you'd say anything to see him die.

319
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,080
你算说对了 
You're gods-damn right I would.

320
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,620
让我做什么
I would do anything,

321
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,580
说什么都行
say anything,

322
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,590
只要能看到那厮惨死
to see that man die a painful death.

323
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,090
没有问题了
No further questions.

324
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,230
把那音乐关了好吗?
Will someone turn off that music?

325
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,270
今天早些时候  示威者在…
MAN: Earlier today, eight protestors were arrested on...

326
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,980
你听到我在说什么吗?
Okay, are you hearing anything I'm saying?

327
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,730
我的天
My Gods.

328
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,280
海军陆战队被部署在舰…
A contingency of Colonial Marines were deployed to the ship.

329
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,280
要点什么?      我不知道要什么好
What can I get you? I don't know what I want.

330
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,540
你看着办吧 你是酒保
You figure it out. You're the bartender.

331
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,620
好 让你意想不到
Okay. Tell you what. I'll surprise you.

332
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,880
好 真不容易     谢谢
SAM: Yes, finally! SEELIX: Thank you!

333
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,840
我这个教练还不赖吧?
About time. I'm not a bad coach, huh?

334
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,440
再来一次         好
One more time. Yeah.

335
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,650
那天晚上我在学校批改作业  然后他们又来了
I was grading papers in the schoolhouse at night and they came again.

336
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,160
庆幸地是孩子们都已经走了 那时是天黑之后
Fortunately, the children were gone. It was after dark.

337
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,160
他们那晚带走了大约200名我们的同胞
They took close to 200 of our people that night,

338
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,580
这是波塔尔直接下令的
under Baltar's direct orders.

339
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,710
而事后证明 我们所有人的名字 
As it turned out, all of our names were on a death list

340
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,630
都在波塔尔博士签署的死刑名单上
signed by Dr. Baltar.

341
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,590
让我们把这件事弄清楚
Let us be crystal clear on this fact.

342
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,430
你是说被告盖尤斯・波塔尔...
You are saying that the defendant, Gaius Baltar,

343
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,180
下令处决你和其他200名民众?
ordered your execution and the execution of 200 other people?

344
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,060
是的  正是  我就是这个意思
Yes, indeed. That's exactly what I'm saying.

345
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,900
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

346
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,910
我们必须找到任何能让他证言站不住脚的东西
BALTAR: We need to find something, anything, that can discredit her testimony.

347
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,330
她是个狂热者  对吧?  我不知道这一条是否有用
She's a fanatic, right? I don't know if that's gonna help.

348
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,200
你好安静
You're awfully quiet.

349
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,040
我在听你们说
I was just listening.

350
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,750
问题在于我是个高明的骗子  而你不是
You see, your problem is, is that I'm a really good liar and you're not.

351
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,260
说说吧
So let's have it.

352
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,720
说什么?
Have what?

353
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,800
我的天  他说对了 你确实知道一些事
My Gods, he's right. You do know something.

354
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,850
你知道一些事  却不肯说
You know something and you're not saying.

355
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,600
是不是真的都不知道 我已经有兴趣了
It's probably not even true. I like it already.

356
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,390
这是私事 我都怀疑她是否会对我说
It's a personal matter. I doubt she'd ever say anything in front of me.

357
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,060
她?  这是与劳拉・罗丝琳有关的事?
She! She! This is about Laura Roslin.

358
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,520
你却不…  告诉我  说啊      闭嘴
And you're not... Tell me, tell me! Shut up!

359
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,740
到现在为止挺自在啊?
Enjoying yourself so far? Hmm?

360
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,530
追随老头子 
Having a good time sticking it to the old man,

361
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,200
来为世上最可恶的人辩护?
defending the most hated person in the universe?

362
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,830
这不是我同意干这份差事的原因
That's not why I agreed to do this.

363
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,540
对 你决定为真相与事实而抗争
No! You just decided to stand up for truth and justice

364
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,920
还有刻在法庭大门上的那些美好事物
and all those other lovely things we inscribe upon courtroom doors.

365
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,090
对
Yeah.

366
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,090
我就是在这么做 因为我相信这套法律体制
That's exactly what I'm doing. Because I believe in the system.

367
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,130
真的相信 我甚至相信…
I really believe... I even believe

368
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,220
我们这位下流胚的委托人应该得到公正的审判
that our lowlife pond scum of a client actually deserves a fair trial.

369
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,690
这里的法制要求你知无不言
The system requires that you tell what you know,

370
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,400
也就只给你留下两个不爽的选择
which leaves you with one of two uncomfortable options.

371
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,110
第一个选择  分享信息  这样做 
First, share the information and in so doing uphold

372
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,450
你可以坚持你所看重的每条原则  或是第二个选择 
the very principles that you claim to hold so dear, or second,

373
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,820
闭口不言
keep them to yourself,

374
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,830
彻底证明… 你来这里的唯一目的就是…
and prove, once and for all, your only purpose here

375
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,660
让你父亲颜面扫地 
is to jab your father in the eye

376
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,870
让整套司法体制成为笑谈
and make a mockery of the entire justice system.

377
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,420
说得好 非常好 但我清楚我来这里的原因
That's very nice. Very, very nice. But I know why I'm here.

378
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,460
我用不着向你或别人证明
I don't need to prove it to you or to anyone else.

379
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,050
你错了
You're wrong.

380
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,130
你要向你自己证明 不然当你离开那法庭的时候
You need to prove it to yourself, or you leave that courtroom out there

381
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,550
就会想到你隐瞒的秘密可以挽救那个人悲惨的生活
knowing you kept a secret that could've saved that man's miserable life.

382
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,640
除非我看错了你
Now, unless I greatly misjudged your character,

383
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,440
否则李・亚当玛可不希望因这件事受到良心的谴责
that's not something that Lee Adama wishes on his conscience.

384
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,230
是什么事  少校?
So what'll it be, Major?

385
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,110
你是想隔岸观火?
Sit on the sidelines mouthing pieties?

386
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,200
还是想参与这场审判
Or are you gonna get in this trial,

387
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,530
提供给我们一些有用的情报?
give us something we can use?

388
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,750
好了  我们能行
Here we go! We made it!

389
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,880
来吧
Here we go, come on!

390
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,670
来吧  好了
Come on. There we go!

391
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,310
来吧
Here we go.

392
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,020
给我酒   你已经喝得够多了
Give me that. You had enough of that already.

393
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,390
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

394
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,770
别担心
Don't worry.

395
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,440
今天有些好消息
Got some good news today.

396
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,700
我们找到泰里恩船上的辐射信号了
We found the radiation signature on the tylium ship,

397
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,320
正如那个赛昂犯人所说的一样
just like the Cylon prisoner said we would.

398
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,030
好极了
Good.

399
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,990
很好
That's great.

400
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,500
此时正在修理它
Being repaired as we speak.

401
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,040
盖塔先生...
Mr. Gaeta

402
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,000
估计舰队离那座星云还有九次跳跃距离
estimates the fleet's nine jumps away from the nebula.

403
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,800
考虑到修理泰里恩船所需的时间
Considering how long it's gonna take to fix the tylium ship,

404
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,340
再有三天的时间
we're out maybe three days.

405
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,220
三天后...
Three days out

406
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,390
就可以找到
from the next clue

407
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,140
通往地球的下一条线索
on the road to Earth.

408
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,480
我闻不到她的气味
I can't smell her.

409
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,150
我闻不到她的气味了  比尔
I can't smell her anymore, Bill.

410
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,910
我留着她的衣物
I kept her clothes,

411
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,530
可她的气味已经消失了
but her smell is gone now.

412
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,340
我得走了  少  真的累了
I gotta go, Saul. I'm really tired.

413
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,460
在法庭上发生的事 真不好意思
I'm sorry about all that in court.

414
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,930
没什么不好意思的
There's nothing to be sorry about.

415
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,180
我让你难堪了 让你很没面子
I embarrassed you. Made you look bad.

416
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,560
你是我的老友  少
You're my oldest friend, Saul.

417
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,230
你不会让我难堪的
You never embarrass me.

418
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,070
休息一下
Get some rest.

419
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,700
前任空军队长可以给上将一个极端的建议吗?
Can the former CAG make a radical suggestion to the Admiral?

420
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,330
我们不修理泰里恩船怎么样?
What if we don't fix the tylium ship?

421
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,580
已经开始修理了
Repairs have already started.

422
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,750
这我知道  不过听我把话说完
I realize that, but hear me out.

423
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,510
我们离那座星云太近 不能仅寄希望于解决问题后 
We're too close to the nebula to simply fix the problem

424
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,300
赛昂人就不会找到我们 所以如果我们不去修理它
and hope the Cylons can't guess where we're going. So, if we don't fix it,

425
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,970
取而代之  我们改变该船的航线
if instead we send the ship off on a new course,

426
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,810
然后派几架猛禽机充当护卫 让他们在与舰队会合之前
with a couple of Raptors riding shotgun, let them make a few jumps

427
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,060
跳跃几次 这样也许就能摆脱赛昂人了
before rejoining the fleet, it might throw the Cylons off.

428
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,770
好主意
It's a good idea.

429
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,110
我考虑一下 还有什么事么?
I'll take it into consideration. Is there anything else?

430
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,030
总统的情况怎么样?
How's the President?

431
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,160
什么?
What?

432
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,700
她的身体还好么?
Is she okay?

433
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,000
她昨天在法庭上看起来有些不知所措
She looked a little rattled in court yesterday.

434
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,630
我们不能在法庭外谈论有关这次审判的事
We can't talk about the trial outside of court.

435
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,840
这你是知道的  应该知道
You know that, or you should.

436
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,510
我知道
I know.

437
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,550
我没有问…
I wasn't asking about...

438
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,050
在你对泰做出了那件事后
After what you did to Tigh,

439
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,520
我最不信任的人就是你
you're the last person I would consider to confide in.

440
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,390
我?
Me?

441
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,900
我没对泰做什么
I didn't do anything to Tigh.

442
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,020
他本来就醉了 不是我的错
He was drunk. It's really not my fault.

443
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,940
你把艾伦的事告诉了拉姆金
You told Lampkin about Ellen.

444
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,990
我都不知道有关艾伦的事
I didn't even know about Ellen.

445
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,410
省省吧
Yeah, right.

446
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,660
你是说我是骗子?
You calling me a liar?

447
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,660
你是骗子加懦夫
I'm calling you a liar and a coward.

448
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,370
一个没胆量
One who doesn't have the guts

449
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,540
去和别人单挑的人
to go after a man himself.

450
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,630
相反 你却把刀递给了一个陌生人
Instead, you hand the shift to a stranger,

451
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,760
让他在泰的背后捅上一刀
and let him stab Tigh in the back.

452
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,550
为了什么?
And for what?

453
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,270
就为了那个卖主求荣的废物 盖尤斯・波塔尔
That traitorous piece of garbage Gaius Baltar.

454
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,640
他就不配得到审判
He doesn't even deserve a trial.

455
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,650
你说完了吗?
Are you done?

456
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,950
完了
Yes.

457
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,610
那我也是
Then so am I.

458
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,930
我不会为一个质疑我的诚信的人效力
I will not serve under a man who questions my integrity.

459
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:26,110
我也不会让一个没有这种品质的人做我的部下
And I won't have an officer under my command who doesn't have any.

460
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,530
法庭上见  上将
I'll see you in court, Admiral.

461
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,310
让我来吧
Let me do this.

462
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,480
什么?
What?

463
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,940
你确定么  少校?
Are you sure, Major?

464
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,400
现在是布衣了 是的  我确定  应该由我来
It's mister now. And yeah, I'm sure. It should be me.

465
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,150
你不是真的要让我的护卫…
You're not seriously gonna let my security guard...

466
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,440
我们在等你  拉姆金先生
We're waiting, Mr. Lampkin.

467
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:21,660
如果法庭赏面 我的同事亚当玛先生将讯问证人
If it please the court, my associate, Mr. Adama, will question the witness.

468
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,160
他的同事
His associate.

469
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,830
辩方可以开始了
The defense may proceed.

470
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,960
谢谢
Thank you.

471
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,730
总统阁下 您能活到今天 难道不是盖尤斯・波塔尔的功劳吗?
Madam President, aren't you alive today because of Gaius Baltar?

472
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:51,320
我能活到今天 是因为起义军竭力阻止死刑的发生
I'm alive today because the insurgents managed to stop the execution.

473
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,030
他们从赛昂行刑队的手底下把您救了出来
Well, they saved you from a Cylon firing squad,

474
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:01,490
不过 难道不是波塔尔在您患上癌症后救您一命吗?
but wasn't it Baltar who saved your life when you were dying from cancer?

475
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,950
有何相干?
Relevance?

476
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,330
法官大人
Your Honors...

477
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,290
敌对证人  法官大人
Hostile witness, Your Honors.

478
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,630
如果法庭可以给我们三分薄面
If the court would grant us just a little latitude.

479
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,460
我们同意
We'll allow it.

480
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,340
谢谢
Thank you. Um...

481
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,930
盖尤斯・波塔尔 是否在您身患癌症的时候挽救了你?
Did Gaius Baltar save your life when you were dying from cancer?

482
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,810
波塔尔博士的科学知识确实挽救了我的生命
Doctor Baltar's scientific knowledge did save my life, indeed.

483
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,610
您能否详述一下?  他那时如何挽救了您的生命?
Can you be more specific? How did he save your life on that occasion?

484
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:37,150
他为我注射了取自一名半赛昂半人类的婴儿的血液
He injected me with the blood of a half-Cylon, half-human baby.

485
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,660
然后您的癌症就消失了?
And your cancer vanished?

486
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,280
完全消失了
Completely.

487
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,540
在您生病期间 您使用了何种药物?
During your illness, what sort of medication were you on?

488
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,750
那时我吃了很多药 
You know, I was taking a lot of medications at the time

489
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,340
无法记住它们所有的名字
and I don't remember all their names.

490
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,630
您是否曾服用过 一种名为卡马拉汁的药品?
Did you take something called chamalla extract?

491
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,970
嗯
Hmm.

492
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,560
是的
Yes.

493
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,280
服用卡马拉的其中一项副作用...
Isnt it true that one of the
side effects of taking chamalla

494
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,910
是可能产生幻觉  这是否是真的?
is a propensity to experience hallucinations?

495
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,530
是的 这是卡马拉其中一项可能的副作用
Yes. That is one of the possible side effects of chamalla.

496
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,500
您所描述的...
And isn't it also true

497
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,170
从诸神那里得来的讯息...
that the visions that you once described as messages

498
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,380
是否可以看作其实是 
from the Gods were actually the result

499
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,590
在服用卡马拉后药物反应的结果?
of a pharmacological reaction from taking chamalla?

500
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,800
卡马拉确实使我看到 
The chamalla did enable me to see certain things

501
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,510
在经文上预言过的某些事物
that were foretold by the scriptures,

502
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,850
可以帮助这支舰队找到通往地球之路的讯息
things that will help this fleet find its way to Earth.

503
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,640
这你应该最清楚不过了  少校      法官大人
You, of all people, should know that, Major. Your Honors.

504
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,310
亚当玛先生 你的用意何在?
Mr. Adama, where are you going with this?

505
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,600
最后一个问题 法官大人
Just one more question, Your Honor.

506
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:10,290
求你别这么做 求你
Please, don't do this. Please.

507
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,710
总统阁下 您此时此刻是否服用了卡马拉?
Madam President, are you taking chamalla at this time?

508
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,590
"阿波罗上尉" 这个称谓你还记得么?
Captain Apollo, you remember that?

509
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,680
一直以来  我认为这是一个响铛铛的名字
I always thought it had such a nice ring to it.

510
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,560
我现在真为你感到惋惜
I am so, so sorry for you now.

511
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,240
卡马拉  总统阁下
Chamalla, Madam President.

512
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,700
也许被溶解在您的茶中来掩盖你的痛苦
Perhaps dissolved in your tea to mask the bitterness.

513
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,870
别回答  我现在就终止这场审判
Don't answer. I'm putting a stop to this, right now.

514
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,441
法官大人 如果她服用了此药 
Your Honors, if she is on drugs, 

515
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:51,040
她作为证人的可信度理应受到质疑
it goes to her credibility as a witness.

516
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,790
证人可以退庭了
Witness is dismissed.

517
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,790
法官大人  我必须强烈反对
Your Honors, I have to strongly object.

518
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,580
他显然试图在掩盖一些事情
He's obviously trying to cover something up, here.

519
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,630
你们再多说一个字  都会因蔑视法庭而被拘禁
One more word from you, and you'll both be held for contempt.

520
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,840
上将!  我想听证人…
Admiral! I'd like to hear the witness

521
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,220
回答问题   我也是
answer the question. As would I.

522
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:09,140
总统阁下 您是否又服用了卡马拉?
Madam President, are you taking chamalla again?

523
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,480
是的  服用了
Yes, I am.

524
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,410
没有问题了
No further questions.

525
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,080
亚当玛先生 难道你不问我为什么吗?
Mr. Adama, aren't you going to ask me why?

526
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,590
什么?  我为什么又再次服用卡马拉?
I'm sorry? Why am I taking chamalla again?

527
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
这并没有很大关系
It's not strictly relevant.

528
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,380
也许与你没什么相干 但却和我有关系
Well, perhaps it's not relevant to you, but it's relevant to me.

529
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,850
继续 问我为什么?
Go ahead. Ask me why.

530
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,770
要有始有终
Finish what you started.

531
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,490
您为什么又再次服用卡马拉 总统阁下?
Why are you talking the chamalla again, Madam President?

532
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,370
我再次服用卡马拉是因为我的癌症复发了
I am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned.

533
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,560
她出现幻觉这一事实 
You know, the fact that she's having hallucinations

534
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,900
与为波塔尔的辩护有联系
is relevant to Baltar's defense.

535
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,480
这就是法制的运作方式  小杜
That's the way the system works, Dee.

536
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,820
被告有权就证人的可信度提出异议
The accused has a right to challenge the credibility of witnesses against him.

537
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,030
事实就是如此
That's just the way it is.

538
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,160
法制已经失效了  李
The system is broken, Lee.

539
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,660
法制选举了那个男人当总统 
The system elected that man to be president

540
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,910
法制还要让他逍遥法外
and the system is trying to let him walk.

541
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,960
这样的制度不值得我们去捍卫
That is not a system that deserves to be defended.

542
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,250
应该废除  应该重建
It deserves to be taken apart and put back together again.

543
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,420
我希望...
You know, I wish...

544
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,560
我希望我能够让你明白
I wish I could make you understand.

545
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,600
我明白  李
I do understand, Lee.

546
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,770
所以我才要离开的
That's why I'm leaving.

547
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,190
你不明白
Well, you don't.

548
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,110
你他妈的不明白
You frakking don't.

549
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,370
总统阁下 您对自己身患癌症所知多久了?
Madam President, how long have you known about the cancer?

550
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,540
大约一周的时间
About a week.

551
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,380
病情如何?
And how advanced is the disease?

552
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,750
您还会从半赛昂人那里输血吗?
Will you be getting any more transfusions from the half-Cylon donor?

553
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,380
我现在不想过多谈及像这样的细节
You know, this is the kind of detail I'm not going to go into now.

554
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,380
我们正在研究对策  制定好计划后我会通知你
You know, we're looking at a game plan. I'll let you know when we have one.

555
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,720
治病对您作为总统来说有多少影响?
Well, how the treatment for your illness impact your duties as president?

556
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,310
目前来说 一点也没有
So far, it hasn't at all.

557
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,140
您当前正在服用卡马拉汁么?
Are you currently taking chamalla extract?

558
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,480
别回答这个问题
Don't answer that.

559
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,730
您出现幻觉的间隔有多久?
How often do you hallucinate?

560
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,440
好了 胡说八道够了没有
All right, enough of this crap.

561
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,860
到此为止 托莉
We're done here. Tory.

562
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,900
你们这些秃鹰可以去找其他死尸了
You vultures can go pick over another carcass.

563
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,820
托莉 过来
Tory! Come here.

564
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,660
我们里面见  谢谢
I'll see you inside. Thank you.

565
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,880
不好意思 最近舰队里的温度比较高
I'm sorry. Temperatures are running a little high in the fleet these days.

566
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,460
到谁了?
Who's next?

567
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,590
克伦
Karen?

568
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,670
总统阁下 您还要活多久?
Madam President, how long do you have to live?

569
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,010
您还要活多久  克伦?
How long do you have to live, Karen?

570
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,110
您处理得很好
You handled that well.

571
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,610
你却没做好
You didn't.

572
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,780
用找其他死尸和我做对比?
"Picked over another carcass," as opposed to mine?

573
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,450
这话被媒体听到可有的瞧了
That's gonna look good in the press.

574
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,780
我不知道为什么自己会那么说
I don't even know why I said that. I...

575
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,700
你这是怎么了?
What is up with you?

576
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,290
几天来 你都无法正常工作  心神不宁  疲惫不堪
You've been off your game for days. You're distracted, you're exhausted.

577
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,120
坦率地讲 你简直让人讨厌
You're just, you know, frankly, you're plain obnoxious.

578
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,790
我近来睡眠不好
I just haven't been sleeping very well.

579
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,460
你要马上调整过来  把精力放在工作上
You need to pull it together and focus on your job, fast,

580
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,210
否则我照样能找到 
or I can find someone

581
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,180
每周梳一次头发的人来应付媒体
who can handle the press, as well as pull a comb through their hair once a week

582
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,750
中尉   早安  副长
Lieutenant. Good morning, XO.

583
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,710
早安
Good morning.

584
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,300
暂时代班而已 上校会…
It's just temporary. The Colonel will...

585
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,460
振作起来的
Pull it together.

586
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,720
说得对
Right.

587
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,430
我们利用泰里恩船作为诱饵...
So, we're using the tylium ship as a decoy

588
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,850
把赛昂人吸引到了几乎与我们方向相反的这条航线上
to lead the Cylons along this course, here, almost directly opposite to ours.

589
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:06,140
当他们抵达这一点的时候 他们就会重新校准超光速引擎
When they reach this point here, they'll recalibrate the FTL,

590
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,810
开始往回跳跃
and start jumping back to rendezvous with Galactica

591
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,270
并将与全体舰队在爱奥尼亚星云这里相遇
and the rest of the fleet, here, at the lonian Nebula.

592
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,480
发现任何赛昂人追踪他们的迹象了吗?
Any indications the Cylons are following them?

593
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:17,360
还没有 他们似乎也停止追踪我们了
Nothing yet. And it would appear they've stopped following us as well.

594
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,490
自从泰里恩船脱离舰队以后 
Our trailing Raptor has yet to pick up any sign of pursuit

595
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,120
我们的猛禽机没发现任何跟踪迹象
since the tylium ship left the fleet.

596
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,160
还有多少次跳跃 我们才能到达那座星云?
How many jumps until we reached the nebula?

597
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,460
呃
Uh...

598
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,500
难以置信 只需最后三次了
It's hard to believe, we're down to the last three.

599
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,300
好
Good.

600
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,130
还有什么事吗  长官?
Is there anything else, sir?

601
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,970
没有  我只是…
No, no. I was just...

602
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,060
只是想起在卡布里卡上...
Just remembering back on Caprica

603
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,270
当要变天的时候 你就能…
when the weather was about to change. You'd...

604
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,690
在空气中闻到这股味道
You'd get this smell in the air.

605
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:54,780
这时可能是烈日当空 万里无云
I mean, the sun could be out, not a cloud in the sky,

606
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,860
可你还是能闻到这股味道 并且知道…
but you'd pick up this smell and you knew that

607
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,530
有什么事情要发生了
something was just over the horizon.

608
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:08,040
要变天了  菲里克斯  我们要做好准备
Weather's changing, Felix. We need to be ready for it.

609
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,420
风暴即将来临了
There's a storm coming.

610
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,350
在船里
It's in the ship.

611
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,690
在他娘的船里
It's in the frakking ship!
