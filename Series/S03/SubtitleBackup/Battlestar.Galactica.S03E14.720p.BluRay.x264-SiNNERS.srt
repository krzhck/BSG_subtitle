00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,350
太空堡垒卡拉狄加 【 前情提要 】
HELO: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,190
我们都做出了牺牲
We all made sacrifices.

3
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,020
是吗?        对
Is that so? Yes, that's right.

4
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,570
那为什么有个赛昂情人 在占着我的职位?
Then how come some Cylon lover is holding down my post?

5
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,860
赫拉还活着 我是她的母亲 我要去找她
ATHENA: Hera's alive. I'm her mother and I'm going to get her.

6
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,530
我求你了
I'm begging you to do this.

7
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,370
你是在以整个舰队冒险 你知道吗?
You've put the entire fleet in jeopardy. Are you aware of that?

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,710
我不是叛徒 我做的是我认为正确的事
I'm not a traitor. I did what I thought was right.

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,210
她会找到赫拉的
She'll get Hera.

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,630
走
Let's go.

11
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,090
别开枪
No! Hold your fire!

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,510
让开
Get out of the way!

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,890
把那东西关禁闭
Throw that thing in the brig.

14
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,350
作为殖民地公民
I demand my rights as a Colonial citizen

15
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,890
我有权要求法律代表出庭 以及完整的法定诉讼程序
to legal representation and full due process.

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,020
是吗?
Do you?

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,690
那下一步怎么办?        让他得到公正的审判
So what happens next? We give him his trial.

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,570
右舷机库真能挤下那么多平民吗?
Do they really think they can squeeze most of these onto the starboard hangar deck?

19
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,030
所以才调西洛来…
That's why Helo was transferred down here,

20
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,950
管理这些难民的
to manage the civilian refugees.

21
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,620
长官 尊者号乘客登舰 现场混乱
Sir, we got the breakdown on the Thera Sita's inhabitants coming aboard.

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,240
51名撒纪特恩人        老天爷
Fifty-one Sagittarons. Oh, boy.

23
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,910
西洛可能应付不过来
Helo might be overmatched down there.

24
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,110
昨晚没怎么睡吧?
So, pretty rough night last night, huh?

25
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,910
你昨晚睡得不太好
Hey, I said you didn't sleep so well.

26
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,280
做的梦让人烦
Just a stupid dream. Whatever.

27
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,750
那你没事?        恩
So, you're okay? Yeah.

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,290
他们还会送来300人 你能顶得住?
They're about to increase the population down there by 300 and you're okay.

29
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,210
能 我不知道该把他们安排到哪里
Yeah. I don't know where I'm gonna put them,

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,050
可我又不是不了解我自己 没事的
but it's not like I'm walking around taking my own pulse. I'm fine.

31
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,880
他在那边    这不是道格维尔的市长么
APOLLO: Hey. There he is. STARBUCK: If it isn't the Mayor of Dogsville.

32
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,510
放他一马吧  兄弟们
RACETRACK: Hey. Cut him some slack, guys.

33
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,050
听说你刚收到一整船忠诚子民
Helo just got a new shipload of loyal subjects.

34
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,560
帮我个忙
Helo, come here, come here. Listen, I need a favor.

35
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,850
今晚我和一位有型的菜鸟帅哥 
I have a date tonight with this ripped and ready nugget

36
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,690
想把关系拉进一步
that I want to break in, you know, just right.

37
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,770
能在下面 给我安排个
Think you can wrangle me up

38
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,980
甜蜜的小寝室不?
one of those cute little sexy cubicles you got down there?

39
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,650
好  好啦        回见  西洛
Yeah, yeah. APOLLO: We'll see you around, Helo.

40
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,780
你们知道到哪可以找到我
Yeah. You guys know where to find me.

41
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,700
你会去看赫拉吧?        会的  宝贝 我会去看她
You're gonna check up on Hera, right? Yes. Babe, I'm gonna check up on Hera.

42
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,620
我爱你    我也爱你
Okay. Love you. Love you, too.

43
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,760
继续走 继续走
HELO: I need you to keep moving. You need to keep moving.

44
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,180
等到了就会处理
Deal with you when we get there.

45
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,310
我们会处理好的 拜托
I know, I know. We'll deal with your concerns. Come on.

46
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,810
继续走 继续走
You just keep moving. Keep moving.

47
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,390
各位  欢迎登上卡拉狄加  我是卡尔・阿格森上尉
Welcome aboard Galactica, people. My name is Captain Karl Agathon.

48
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,400
我被派来处理各位的福利问题 
I've been assigned to look after your personal welfare.

49
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,520
我们很快就会办理  各位先继续向前走
We'll get to it soon. I need you to keep moving right now.

50
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,610
你们把撒纪特恩人安排在哪里?
Where are you putting the Sagittarons?

51
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,030
住宿安排还没有定下来 先生  
Living arrangements haven't been made yet, sir.

52
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,030
继续向前走    我们要和自己人在一起
I need you to keep moving. We want to be with our own!

53
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,740
你听到他说的话了 快走
You heard the man. Get your ass in motion!

54
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,870
走!
Move!

55
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,580
一切都在我的控制之下  上校
I got things under control here, Colonel.

56
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,490
恩  是的
Yeah. Sure you do.

57
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,540
打扰下  女士 我能大致检查一下你的儿子吗?
Excuse me, ma'am? Could I have a brief look at your son?

58
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,880
不用了  我们很好  我们没事  不用看医生
No, no, no. We're fine. We're fine. We don't need a doctor.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,630
知道 谢谢
I know. I know. Thank you.

60
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,590
我们不用看医生
Look. We don't need a doctor.

61
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,430
我们是撒纪特恩人 我们不相信药物
We're Sagittaron. We don't believe in medicine.

62
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,850
没事的  女士  这位是罗伯特医生  他是民间医生 
It's all right, ma'am. This is Dr. Robert. He's our civilian doctor.

63
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,970
与军方没有关联
He has nothing to do with the military.

64
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,850
相信我 我们会尊重你们的传统
He'll respect your traditions. You can trust me.

65
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,440
我也是撒纪特恩人 不会有事的
I'm a Sagittaron. It's okay.

66
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,940
没事的 可以了?
It's okay. Okay? Okay?

67
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,110
疼吗?
You feel that?

68
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,110
请把嘴张开  好吗?  张大一些
Would you open your mouth for me, please? Open wide.

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,660
好
All right.

70
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,040
看这个
Look at this.

71
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,000
有什么感觉吗?  这里呢?
Okay. Do you feel anything? How about here?

72
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,460
好了  够了 谢谢
All right. That's enough. Thank you.

73
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,840
把你的手拿开!        好  
Get your hands off me! ROBERT: All right, okay.

74
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,460
再等一下    够了  
Just a second... That's enough. That's enough.

75
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,130
谢谢
Thank you very much. Settle down.

76
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,590
先生   把你的手管好
Sir... Hey, you just keep your hands to yourself.

77
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,100
好  好的
Okay. Yeah. All right?

78
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,610
麦克
TIGH: Mike.

79
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,120
你个出老千的笨蛋 还欠我一杯酒钱
You brain-dead card cheat. Still owe me that drink.

80
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,830
少 闪一边去    今天你心情不错哇
Saul, get out of here now. Well, you're in a good mood today.

81
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,790
医生  我说不准  可这里有些人看来…
Hey, Doc. I don't know, but some of these people, they look...

82
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,080
有病 有病 对
Sick. Sick. Yeah.

83
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,670
急救员!
My God! Medic!

84
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,840
罗伯特医生?        离开这里  少
DUALLA: Dr. Robert! Leave, Saul.

85
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,260
好
Yeah.

86
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,590
别碰我的儿子
No, get your hands off my son!

87
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,640
好了        别碰  别碰
I got him. No. No!

88
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,260
他们要把他带到哪里去?
Where are they taking him?

89
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,850
没事  女士 这边走
It's all right, ma'am. Just walk this way.

90
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,590
什么情况  麦克?
So what have we got here, Mike?

91
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,140
梅罗莱克病
Mellorak Sickness.

92
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,510
它源于肾脏
It originates in the kidneys

93
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,890
而后迅速扩展到呼吸及免疫系统
and then rapidly attacks the respiratory and the immune system.

94
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,770
这种病比较让人头疼
It's a nasty bit of business.

95
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,980
如果首发症状无法在48小时内得到医治
If you don't treat the first symptoms within 48 hours,

96
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,270
患者将在三到五天内死亡
it'll kill you within three to five days.

97
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,820
传染性如何?
How contagious is it?

98
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,700
不是空气传播 所以我们也算是走运
Well, it's not airborne, so we lucked out there.

99
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,410
它通过人与人之间接触传染
It's spread through human contact,

100
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,620
唾液  性交 皮肤接触
saliva, sexual intercourse, through the skin...

101
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,710
目前看来 这种病还仅限于撒纪特恩人之中
Right now, it seems confined to the Sagittarons.

102
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,460
那就好 不用他们道谢了
That's good. They're welcome to it.

103
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,960
传播地点显然正是我们工作的地方
It's obviously spreading down there where we were working.

104
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,340
可治愈吗?        绝对可以
It's curable? Absolutely, yes.

105
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,510
打一针贝他霉素 患者在一两天内就生龙活虎了
A shot of bittamusin and you're right as rain in a day or two.

106
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,890
镇静剂也可以缓解病情
And sedatives alleviate the symptoms.

107
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,470
但我不知道我们的贝他霉素库存量能坚持多久
But I don't know how long our stock of bittamusin will hold out,

108
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,810
所以我们应该先存起来
so we should probably conserve it

109
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,890
等首发症状出现后 再用作预防注射
and only inoculate after the first symptoms show.

110
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,230
这是民间传染病  罗伯特医生  所以应该由你来负责
ADAMA: This is a civilian infection, Dr. Robert, so it's in your hands.

111
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,480
不过蒂罗尔和其他船员 必须接种疫苗以防生病
But I want Tyrol and the crew immunized before they get sick.

112
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,440
不能有丝毫懈怠
I don't need any downtime.

113
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,700
如果消毒后加强卫生 有些人就不会得病了
If we disinfect everything and stress hygiene, some people won't get sick.

114
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,280
他们也就不需要药品
And they won't need the medicine.

115
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,290
应该让每人都冲澡吧?
Then shouldn't we get everyone to the showers?

116
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,160
尤其是撒纪特恩人 我们应该发出通知
Especially the Sagittarons. We should make an announcement.

117
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:28,420
到此地步  我们不能再孤立他们了
No. No, we don't want to single them out any more than we already have to.

118
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
否则就会引发骚乱
We'll have a riot on our hands.

119
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,090
要我说 就先安排好撒纪特恩人
Now, if it were up to me, I would say just get the Sagittarons settled

120
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,140
然后再处理其他民众
and then deal with the civvies that have already arrived.

121
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,430
至少用不着担心给撒纪特恩人的药品会不够用
Well, at least, you won't have to worry about having enough medicine for the Sagittarons.

122
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,150
对   他们中大部分人都会拒绝使用
Yeah. Most of them are gonna refuse it.

123
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,150
有人会因此而死掉
People are going to die.

124
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,650
3000年以来 药物一直被认作是不详之物
For the last 3,000 years, medicine's been the great curse.

125
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,240
那是因为他们 是一群食古不化  专吃树根的蠢货
That's because they're a bunch of stubborn root-sucking jackasses

126
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,620
只会守着千年的传统不放
holding onto traditions that are 1,000 years old.

127
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,090
喝吧
Drink this.

128
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:32,480
够臭吧?        恩  确实刺鼻
Stink enough for you in here? Yeah, it's a really potent smell, yeah.

129
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,780
牛蒡根 撒纪特恩人用它来做镇静剂    
That's burdock root. The Sagittarons use it as a calmative.

130
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,910
有效吗?
Does it work?

131
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,290
哼  不知道  反正他们都难逃一死
Hell, I don't know. They're all gonna die anyway.

132
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,920
审判不是真的吧
ZAREK: Tell me there won't be a trial.

133
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,430
盖尤斯・波塔尔 将因重罪和叛国罪而受到审判
Gaius Baltar will be tried for high crimes and treason.

134
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,970
仲裁庭的法官将会听取指证他的证据
A tribunal of judges will hear the evidence against him.

135
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,810
将宣判对他的裁决 他会被判为有罪
A verdict will be read. He will be found guilty

136
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,440
他最终会为他的行为负责
and he will be finally held responsible for his actions.

137
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,230
如果你可以同我一样有些耐心
If you can summon up a little patience, as I have done,

138
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,440
我们就会经受住这次考验
we will get through this ordeal.

139
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,780
听我说 波塔尔会受到审判
Listen to me. Baltar will get his trial.

140
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,740
而你得到的将会是一场飓风 (译注:暗指来势凶猛的考验)
And this is what you'll get, a hurricane.

141
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,580
媒体将会如期而至 
The media will descend on you

142
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,460
密切监视 质问你的一举一动
and watch and scrutinize and question your every move.

143
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,080
教派冲突
You will have sectarian violence.

144
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,130
刺杀行动
You will have assassination attempts.

145
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,670
还有你从没见过的大规模内乱
You will have civil unrest on a scale we've never seen.

146
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,390
工作  劳动 这支舰队的每项日常工作都将停止
Work, labor, everyday routine in this fleet will come to a complete halt.

147
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,680
这场审判将会使整个舰队走向灭亡
This trial is going to bring this entire fleet down.

148
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,060
副总统阁下 我们有相应的安全计划
Mr. Vice President, we have a security plan in order,

149
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,350
包括迅速布置陆战队 
which includes rapid marine deployment,

150
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,560
增加空中巡逻行动  安全卫士
increased CAP operations, security details...

151
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,770
一场飓风  劳拉
A hurricane, Laura.

152
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,330
换作是我 在审判期间 我会宣布戒严法
If I were you, I'd declare martial law during the trial.

153
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,500
要活下来 光有耐心是不够的
You're going to need a lot more than a little patience to survive.

154
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,710
有事叫我
I'm here if you need me.

155
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,340
至友至敌
Your best friend, your worst enemy.

156
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,840
我从没看过他这个样子
I've never seen him like that.

157
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,890
他真的害怕了
He was truly frightened.

158
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,480
我们没病
MAN: We are not sick.

159
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,860
是狗撒把病带来的 把他们赶回去!
Sagits brought the sickness with them. Send them back!

160
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,030
好  先生 你说我把他们赶到哪里去?
Okay, sir. Where do you suggest that I send them?

161
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,370
不知道 你们自己想办法
I don't know. Figure it out.

162
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,330
好 我们已经了解你们的问题了 我们会尽力而为
Okay. Your concerns have been noted. We're going to do the best we can.

163
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,120
算了吧  鬼才信
Yeah, right you will.

164
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,880
有什么事可以为您效劳吗?
Yes. Can I help you?

165
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,920
我儿子死了
My son is dead.

166
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,060
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,230
那是"胴穗"吧?
It's a soma braid, right?

168
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,020
你们撒纪特恩人以为它能带来安康?
You Sagittarons believe it's supposed to bring good health?

169
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,030
抱歉 仅限于此是不够的
Look, I'm sorry. It's not enough.

170
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,150
如果你不治疗  这病是会出人命的
If you don't treat the disease, it's fatal, okay?

171
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,030
这本不该发生
This... This didn't have to happen.

172
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,700
不  这是必然的  他是被别人害死的
Yes, it did. He was killed.

173
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,250
不是 女士 他是病死的 他的死是因为他本需要的是真正的药品
No. Ma'am, he died. Okay? He died because he needed real medicine.

174
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,380
他的死 是因为我犯了一个错误
He died because I made a mistake.

175
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,170
对
Okay.

176
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,630
好  对  请让大家都知道
Okay. Good. Yeah. Then, please, tell the others.

177
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,300
我会的 我会告诉他们不要相信他
I will. I will tell them not to trust him.

178
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,470
他们警告过我要提防他 但我没听
They warned me about him, but I wouldn't listen.

179
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,850
我不想让我儿子死掉
I didn't want my son to die.

180
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,100
我挺而走险 去找罗伯特医生
I took a chance. I went to Dr. Robert.

181
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,230
我让那医生给威利用了药
I let the doctor give the medicine to Willie.

182
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,700
女士 你耽搁得太久了
Ma'am, you waited too long.

183
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,370
威利生病前后不到12小时
Willie had been sick for less than 12 hours.

184
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,870
他才19岁  就这么死了
He was 19. He is dead.

185
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,590
是那医生害死了我的儿子
That doctor killed my son.

186
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,400
昨晚又死一个人
We lost another one last night.

187
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,650
对  威利・金
Yeah. Willie King.

188
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,740
不是 一个三岁的小女孩 她的父母拒绝让我治疗她
No. A three-year-old girl whose parents refused to let me treat her.

189
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,540
威利・金的母亲失去了威利・金
Willie King's mother lost Willie King.

190
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,790
他的死真可惜 他来的时候你也看到了 
It's a shame. That boy was a goner. You saw him when he came in here.

191
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,130
出现症状的三天后才来
I mean, he was at least three days symptomatic.

192
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,260
这事你和他母亲解释过了?        是的  那是当然
You explained this to the mother? Yes. Of course I did.

193
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,340
我能和她怎么说?
I mean, what the hell am I supposed to say to her?

194
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,430
我很遗憾  女士  但如果你能 
"Sorry, ma'am, but if you would have just turned the corner a little sooner

195
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,230
早些放弃那些迷信思想  你的儿子可能就有救了?
"on your superstitious crap, we could have saved your son"?

196
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,980
把你的衬衫脱掉  好吗?        什么?
Get your shirt off, would you? Excuse me?

197
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,770
我要给你打疫苗
I'm going to vaccinate you.

198
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,980
可我没有病  我们不是在限量供应么
But I'm not sick. I thought we were rationing.

199
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,200
你以为我要看到你躺在床上以后才来治你吗?
You think I'm gonna wait until you're on your back for a day?

200
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,530
那样谁来帮我?
Who the hell else is gonna help me around here?

201
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,950
好  那好吧
Okay. All right.

202
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:37,040
我和泰聊过 他问我关于你的事
I talked to Tigh. He was asking about you.

203
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,620
我告诉他你工作很出色
I told him you were doing a hell of a job.

204
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,380
找不到第二个合适的人选
I mean, I wouldn't wish this place on anybody.

205
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,670
来  准备好了?        恩
Come on. You ready? Yeah.

206
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,380
可能会有点疼 好了
This might sting a bit. You're done.

207
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,220
嗯
Yes!

208
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,470
好了  "僵尸手"
Awesome! All right, "Hands of Stone. "

209
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,230
让我看看你有什么能耐    玛吉  要投中哦
Let me see what you got. CONNOR: Put it in the hole, Marge.

210
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,480
想知道我的秘诀是什么吗  康纳?  我把球洞当作是你的脸
Want to know my secret, Connor? I pretend this thing is your face.

211
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,410
是梅罗莱克(病)大侠  大家快闪呐
Hey. It's Mellorak Man. Everybody run.

212
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,200
别紧张 医生给我打过预防针了
Relax. The doc dosed me.

213
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,870
听说下面挺惨烈的 除非你是撒纪特恩人
I hear it's pretty rough down there, huh? Only if you're a Sagittaron.

214
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,500
那些垂死的人看起来好傻
Dying, you know? It just... It just seems so senseless.

215
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,630
我是不会掉眼泪的
Yeah, well, you'll get no tears from me.

216
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,970
我的兄弟们还要在他们的恶臭中 挥汗如雨就已经够烦的了
Bad enough my gang's gotta sweat through their stench.

217
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,140
我有预感 等到有一天药品不够用的时候
I have a feeling, one of these days, we're gonna wake up in the morning,

218
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,270
我会很恼火
I'm gonna be really pissed 'cause we're out of meds

219
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,600
就因为那些混球开窍了 我们要和他们分享药品
'cause those frakwads saw the light and now we gotta share.

220
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,810
你要唠叨个没完 还是投球?
Will you babble or shoot?

221
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,400
好!
Yeah!

222
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,240
那些宗教怪胎
None of those religious 

223
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,650
在新卡布里卡上打赛昂人的时候没出一点力
freaks lifted a finger down on New Caprica against the Cylons.

224
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,490
轮机长  算了吧
Hey. Chief, knock it off.

225
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,120
许多抵抗军战士英勇牺牲
Well, a lot of good Resistance people lost their lives.

226
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,540
我说过别再说了
I said knock it off. All right?

227
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,370
哦
Oh.

228
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,830
不好意思  小杜    没事
Sorry, Dee. It's all right.

229
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,880
我比你们更有理由 生他们的气  我本身就是撒纪特恩人
I have more of a reason to be mad at them than you do. I am Sagittaron.

230
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,590
他们中大部分人疑神疑鬼 愚蠢顽固  争强斗狠
Most of them are paranoid, pigheaded and argumentative.

231
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,970
他们确实把罗伯特医生弄得惨兮兮的
Yeah, well, they're sure making it miserable for Dr. Robert.

232
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,390
药物是令人憎恶的东西  是有违神旨的罪过
Medicine's an abomination. It's a sin against the Gods.

233
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,390
医生在散布疾病 因为他们拒绝承认身体…
Physicians are spreading disease because they refuse to acknowledge that the body...

234
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,600
进了
APOLLO: There you go.

235
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,400
和心灵是神话的产物    这副身体不是神秘之物
...and the mind are myths. Well, this body is no myth.

236
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,660
如果我病了 我就去找罗伯特医生    你不会生病的
If I get sick, I'm gonna see Dr. Robert. You're not getting sick.

237
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,820
除了科特尔谁都可以 
Anyone but Cottle.

238
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,240
那个四眼混蛋说不定会拿长钉代替针头
The near-sighted bastard might as well use a spike instead of a needle.

239
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,830
那他们对你还挺好的?    恩  还好
So, they're treating you well, then? Yeah. Well enough.

240
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,510
他们要花些时间才会切入正题  不是么?
Take a while to get to the point, though, don't they?

241
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,840
六号 谢谢你能这么做
Look, Six, I want to thank you for what you did.

242
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,220
虽然我还不清楚你这么做的原因
I'm still not sure why you did it, though.

243
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,730
确实如此
Exactly.

244
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,900
我们来这里干什么?
What are we doing here?

245
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,620
你怎么可以对这些人动了恻隐之心?
How could you possibly throw yourself on the mercy of these people?

246
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,620
可你却落得这份境遇  恩
ATHENA: And now you're here. Yeah.

247
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,420
如果你想保住性命 只能和他们合作
Your best chance of survival is to work with them.

248
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,420
就是说要帮他们把波塔尔的罪行昭之天下
And that means to help them expose Baltar for his crimes.

249
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,130
我得走了
Look, I gotta go,

250
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,510
我会为你找些衣服
so I'm gonna look into getting some clothes for you.

251
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,970
照顾好自己
Please, take care of yourself.

252
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,730
嗨
Hey.

253
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,480
谢谢你来看我
Thank you for the visit.

254
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,450
能让我有个伴 谢谢
To have some company. Thank you.

255
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,740
恩  我担心你
ATHENA: No. I care about you.

256
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,340
你以为他们中的每个人都担心你?
BALTAR: Do you think any of them care about you?

257
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,020
我可没那么想
I imagine they don't.

258
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,480
那你为什么还要来这里?
So what are you doing here again?

259
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,360
我还在考虑这个问题
I'm still trying to figure that out.

260
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,150
你是来救他的吧?
So you're here to save him, are you?

261
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,360
我说过了我不知道
I told you, I don't know.

262
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,540
你之所以来这里是因为你想成为人类
You're here because you want to be human.

263
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,210
要成为人类可有个窍门
There's a trick to being human.

264
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,550
你必须只求自保
You have to think only about yourself.

265
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,320
你说她现在又是在做什么?    不知道
ROSLIN: Okay. What do you think she's doing now? I don't know.

266
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,860
像是在自言自语或是和某人说话
Though she's talking to something or someone, I don't know.

267
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,240
我以前也看到过她这个样子
I've seen her do it before.

268
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,380
他要害死我    退后
MAN: He'll kill me! Stay back!

269
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,790
够了
Enough!

270
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,090
他要杀了我们
WOMAN: He'll frakking kill us!

271
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,840
不能让他这么做了 他是凶手    不！
MAN 2: You can't let him do it! He's a murderer! MAN 3: No!

272
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,550
后退!
Stand back!

273
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,390
别碰我  抓住他
MAN 4: Get off me! MAN 5: Get him!

274
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,550
后退
Stay back!

275
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,350
都散开！
GUARD: Break it up!

276
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,600
放开我!
Get off me!

277
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,270
后退 都后退    离他远点!
MAN 6: Stay back! Everybody back! MAN 7: Step away from him!

278
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,230
都后退
Everybody back!

279
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,940
放开他  都后退
Get off him! Now! Move back, people!

280
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,110
后退 立即后退
Move back! Back away, now!

281
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,200
他害死了我父亲
He killed my father!

282
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,320
我想救他 你个愚昧的笨蛋!
I tried to help him, you ignorant fool!

283
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,530
放开我!
Get off me!

284
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,580
到我后面去
Okay. Get behind me.

285
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,160
都后退
GUARD: Back down, everybody.

286
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,040
你给那位大爷打了预防针 可他还是死了?
So you immunized the old man, but he still died.

287
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,880
巴克明斯特和他父亲同是原教派
Buckminster and his father are fundamentalists.

288
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,930
为什么他们改变了主意来打预防针?
What made them change their mind about getting immunized?

289
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,180
"他们改变了主意"?  谁说他们改变了主意?
Change their mind? Who said they changed their mind?

290
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:31,350
我亲自给他注射的贝他霉素    未经他们同意?
I administered the bittamusin on my own. Without their consent?

291
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,310
当时是深夜
Look, it was the middle of the night.

292
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,060
我在巡诊  那老头疼得直叫
I was doing my rounds and the old man was screaming in pain.

293
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,730
你说我能怎么办?
I mean, what was I supposed to do?

294
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,110
我不明白 我们不是在限量供应吗?
Okay, I don't understand. Aren't we rationing?

295
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,620
48小时后  就回天乏术了
It was well after the 48 hours.

296
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,040
话是没错  但也不准确  人和人不同
Yeah, that's right. But it's not exact. Everybody's different.

297
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,620
好吧  我承认 他已经奄奄一息了
Okay. He was marginal.

298
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,130
我不会坐在这里  为我的尽职尽责而向你道歉
Look, I'm not gonna sit here and apologize to you for doing my job.

299
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,550
那边还有两个派亢人  他们已经开始出现该症状了
Now I got two Picons down there that are starting to show symptoms.

300
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,260
如果你不介意 我要去看一下他们的病情
Now I'm gonna go treat them, if it's all right with you.

301
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680
医生给他用药的时间 
The doctor's version of when he administered the drug

302
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,100
与给金女士的相比有很大的出入
greatly differed from that of Mrs. King.

303
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,930
谁?        那个女人  金
Who? The woman. King.

304
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,390
我与您说过的  金女士  她的儿子在出现了症状后
The one I told you about. Mrs. King. Her son showed symptoms.

305
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,320
她马上带他去罗伯特那里医治  但那孩子还是死了
She immediately took him to Robert for treatment. The boy still died.

306
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,130
另一件病例中 
In the other case, 

307
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:23,530
罗伯特在未经那个撒纪特恩人许可的情况下就治疗他
Robert treated a Sagittaron without the man's consent.

308
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,570
我们从一开始 就不应该对他们这样
That's something we probably should have done to all of them in the first place.

309
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,410
不然这里早就没有这种病了
This disease would have been gone by now.

310
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,530
我们之所以没这么做 
The only reason we didn't

311
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,660
是因为尊重撒纪特恩人的风俗
is we're trying to respect the customs of the Sagittarons.

312
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,290
说的就是这点 他并没尊重他们的风俗
But that's the point. He didn't respect them, sir.

313
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,370
经过罗伯特医治的人 可能会死掉
People could be dying under Robert's care.

314
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,380
每天经过我医治的人也会死掉 这该死的差事就是这样
People die under my care every day. It goes with the damn job.

315
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,090
害人不算在内    "害人"?
Killing doesn't. Killing?

316
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,840
你这可就太过分了
You are way out of line.

317
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,300
麦克・罗伯特 可不应当受到这种对待
Mike Robert deserves better than this.

318
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,140
就算是我弄错了 就算他没对这些人做出什么 有损医德的事
Even if I'm wrong, even if he isn't treating some of these people unethically,

319
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,980
我担心 他还是造成了一定影响
I'm concerned he's created a situation down there.

320
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,480
不好的影响
It's bad.

321
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,270
上尉
Captain,

322
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,650
我这里有一位锒铛入狱的前殖民地总统
I have the former President of the Colonies sitting in a prison cell,

323
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,360
一个被监禁的赛昂女人
a Cylon woman is in custody,

324
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,990
还有一群恨不得将他们五马分尸的民众
and a population that would love nothing more than to tear both of them apart.

325
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,830
我的战舰上人满为患  手头上又出现了传染病
My ship is overcrowded and I have an epidemic on my hands.

326
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:22,210
现在的问题是你是否能胜任这份工作?
Now the question is are you capable of doing your job?

327
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,050
是否能停止这些无根无据的指控?
And are you gonna stop making these unfounded accusations?

328
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,680
能吗?
Are you?

329
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,310
能  长官        解散
Yes, sir. Dismissed.

330
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,950
阿格森!
TIGH: Agathon!

331
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,580
就此罢手吧  西洛
Why don't you knock it off, Helo?

332
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,710
别吃饱了撑的再找医生的麻烦了 这么做对你没好处
Get your teeth out of the doc's ass. It's not doing you any good.

333
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,670
恕我直言  长官  我认为麦克・罗伯特可能在害人
With all due respect, sir, I think Michael Robert might be hurting people.

334
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,260
据我所知 他是唯一一个…
He is the only one who's had anything good to say about you

335
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,890
说你好话的人
in as long as I can remember.

336
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,770
你把你仅存的一点可信度 
You may as well take whatever credibility you have left

337
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,220
也拱手送了出去
and chuck it out an airlock.

338
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,350
你真要替这些疯子出头?
You seriously want to stand up for these crazy frakking people?

339
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,230
你哪根筋不对了?
What is it with you?

340
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:27,900
你就是喜欢隔岸观火  对吧?
You just like being on the outside looking in, don't you?

341
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,400
我太不明白 你这句话是什么意思
I don't quite know what you mean by that, sir.

342
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,910
除非你是在说我的妻子 旧事重提?
Unless you're referring to my wife. Again.

343
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,666
麦克・罗伯特是顶天立地的汉子 
Mike Robert is a stand-up guy. 

344
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,700
卡布里卡人  自己人 我信赖的人
A Caprican. One of our own. A man I can trust.

345
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,960
在新卡布里卡 他与抵抗军共同作战
On New Caprica, he worked with the Resistance.

346
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,330
他修补了我的眼睛 他与敌人作斗争
He patched up my eye. He fought the enemy,

347
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,000
而你这时候正和你那赛昂老婆在被窝里亲亲我我
while you were snuggled up in bed with your Cylon wife every night...

348
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,880
上校!
GUARD: Colonel!

349
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,220
还好吧?
You okay?

350
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,150
你他妈还是很在意你的朋友们的想法的?
So you do give a frak what your friends think.

351
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,980
很好 就该这样
Good for you. That's how it should be.

352
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,740
但你要知道 我他妈也在乎
But you know what? I give a frak, too.

353
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,780
我也在乎朋友  在乎对朋友的忠诚
About friends, about loyalty.

354
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,330
你再去败坏老麦的名声  我就和你没完
You keep soiling Mike Robert's good name and we are gonna finish this.

355
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,120
怎么样?
How does that sound to you?

356
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,250
去让医生看一下你的手吧
Better have the doctor take a look at that hand, huh?

357
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,150
抱歉  你要先等等
HELO: Sorry, people, you're gonna have to wait.

358
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,520
借过  借过
Excuse me. Excuse me.

359
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,860
15分钟  各位  我在15分钟后回来  抱歉
Fifteen minutes, people. I'll be back in 15 minutes. I'm sorry.

360
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,130
借过  借过  先生  把手拿开
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sir, get your hands off me.

361
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,300
莎伦    西洛
Sharon? Helo!

362
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,760
出什么事了?  赫拉怎么样了?
What's going on? How's Hera?

363
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,470
什么意思?
What do you mean, "How's Hera?"

364
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,680
她在大约一小时前生病了 他们把我从巡逻任务中换了下来
She got sick about an hour ago. They pulled me off CAP.

365
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,140
什么意思? 没人告诉我啊
What are you talking about? No one told me.

366
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,850
他们把她送到罗伯特医生那里了
They sent her to Dr. Robert.

367
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,620
我还没考虑好  她是否真的需要打针
Okay. You know what? I don't know if she needs this.

368
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,830
这是大事  她会死的
Hey, this is serious. She could die from this.

369
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,330
好了  来吧  没事  没事  看这个
All right, here we go. Here we go. Okay. It's all right. Look at this.

370
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,170
看这个 你的玩具在这里
Look at this. Here. Here's your toy.

371
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,090
好孩子  好孩子
Good girl. Good girl.

372
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,050
这些是口服镇静剂
Now, these are a sedative in pill form. Okay.

373
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,090
每六小时一片 压碎后服用
Just give her a half every six hours. Just crush it up.

374
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,390
好的
Okay. Okay?

375
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,890
她应该没什么事吧?    没事的 你可以带她回家了
She'll be okay, though? She'll be fine. You can take her home.

376
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,230
谢谢你  医生
Thank you, Doctor. Okay.

377
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,520
拜拜
Bye-bye. Say bye.

378
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,690
好  拜拜
Good night. Bye-bye.

379
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,360
我们要走了  快说拜拜
ATHENA: Good, we're done. Say bye-bye.

380
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,030
拜拜
Bye-bye.

381
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,910
她不会有事的
She'll be fine. All right?

382
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,160
知道了吧?
Okay.

383
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,580
好
Oh, um...

384
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,580
帮我把这个给金女士好吗?    这是…
Listen, would you give this to Mrs. King? This is...

385
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:35,420
她儿子的 应该还给她
It belonged to her son. I know she'd want it back.

386
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,470
好吗?
All right?

387
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,780
你好
Hi.

388
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,410
罗伯特医生让我把这个还给你
Dr. Robert gave me this to give to you.

389
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,920
这是他给你的?
He gave you this?

390
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,390
你的女儿怎么样了?
How is your daughter?

391
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,930
挺好的  谢谢        那就好
She's fine, thanks. Good.

392
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,060
金女士 请留步
Mrs. King? Please.

393
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,730
我要问你一些事
I need to ask you something.

394
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,000
如果你认为罗伯特医生是个危险人物 为什么要让他给你儿子看病
If you thought Dr. Robert was dangerous, why let him treat your son?

395
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,750
你说过已经有人警告过你了
I mean, you said you were warned.

396
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,090
我无法相信一个人的心里能藏有那么大仇恨
I couldn't believe anyone could have that much hate inside of them.

397
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:02,300
可你也知道...        我要说的话已经说完了
But you understand how... I'm through talking.

398
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,220
就算再说 威利也不会活过来了
Talking isn't going to bring Willie back.

399
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,600
我看你应该离开了
I think you should leave now.

400
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,270
金女士  我…
Mrs. King, I...

401
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,440
抱歉
I'm sorry.

402
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,250
看你一副怒不可遏的样子
You seem angry.

403
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,760
没有  只是… 工作上的事
I'm not. I'm just... Work.

404
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,840
不喜欢你的工作没关系 不喜欢就直说 没关系
It's okay that you hate your job. It's okay to admit it, too.

405
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,600
不是工作本身的事 这个差事费力不讨好 
It's not the job. I know the job sucks.

406
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,390
不用你说我也知道
I don't need to be reminded of it.

407
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,810
那好
Okay.

408
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,270
那是什么事?
Then what is it? Look.

409
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,570
我每天都能看到那些事 不想看到都不行
It's what I see every day, okay? It's hard to not see it.

410
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,980
看到什么事?
See what?

411
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,990
说话  卡尔    我不知道
Talk to me, Karl. I don't know, I keep doing it.

412
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,910
可总是这样 干什么事都是事与愿违
You know, I keep doing it. I keep ending up on the wrong side of everything.

413
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,120
可能泰说得对 可能我就想这样
You know, maybe Tigh's right. Maybe I want it that way.

414
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,080
如果让我做文案工作 并不因为这是我的专长
What if I'm flying a desk, not because I'm good at it,

415
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,790
或我是合适人选
not because I'm the right guy for the job,

416
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,920
而是因为众所周知 这就是…
but because it's the right punishment for the guy who crosses the line

417
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,550
对我所做所为的惩罚呢
and everybody knows it?

418
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,800
也许我就该呆在道格维尔
Maybe I belong in Dogsville.

419
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,930
你是说...
So, you're saying...

420
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,260
算了
Just leave it.

421
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,640
"算了"是什么意思?
What does that mean, "Just leave it"?

422
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,600
意思是管理这些人是你的职责所在
It means it's your job to manage these people, Helo,

423
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,020
你必须去做
and you just gotta do it.

424
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,070
恩
Yeah. You know what?

425
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,860
你说对了 是我自己的错
You're right. It's me.

426
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,990
我自己想不开
It's all in my frakking head.

427
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,830
我没那么说
I didn't say that.

428
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,500
去哪里?      不知道
Where are you going? I don't know.

429
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,060
医生?
Doc?

430
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,040
上床睡一会吧  西洛 那样还能多睡会
You ought to try a bed, Helo. You'll get more sleep that way.

431
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,550
他在暗害他们  这上面写得清清楚楚
He's killing them. It's right here.

432
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,550
你快给我出去
You get your righteous ass out of here right now,

433
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,510
不然我就让老头子关你禁闭 不让你出来
before I have the old man lock you up and throw away the key.

434
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,720
不  听我说  他在新卡布里卡上就害死了他们
No, listen to me. He killed them, on New Caprica.

435
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:40,640
看这里 这名男性来时只是咳嗽 死因却是心脏衰竭
Look. Guy goes in for a cough, he dies of heart failure.

436
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,230
你自己看
Here. See for yourself!

437
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,230
看这个 这名女性只是阑尾炎 
This one. Woman had simple appendicitis.

438
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,770
却死在了手术台上
She died on the operating table.

439
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,110
他医治的派亢人 死亡率为12%
Of the Picons he treated? Twelve percent of them died.

440
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,200
卡布里卡人呢  他喜欢卡布里卡人  死亡率是6%
Capricans. He likes Capricans. The mortality rate was six percent.

441
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,030
撒纪特恩人的死亡率是90%  90%的撒纪特恩人死在了…
Sagittarons? Ninety percent. Ninety percent of the Sagittarons died...

442
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,080
我不会听信这些的 明白吗?
I'm not going to listen to this! You hear me?

443
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,080
那个人在下面忙得不可开交
That man has his hands full down there.

444
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,790
他针对的是撒纪特恩人 你就置之不理吗?
He's singling out Sagittarons! That doesn't bother you?

445
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,460
他到底…    医生  你不管吗?
What exactly... Doctor, that doesn't bother you?

446
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,010
他到底在干什么?        不知道 我又不是医生
What exactly is he doing? I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

447
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,420
这是你说的第一句清醒话
Well, now that's the first sensible thing you've said yet.

448
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,380
他给他们开的不是药品
Listen to me. I don't think he's giving them the medicine.

449
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,930
这里有鬼  他在搞鬼
Something. He's doing something!

450
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,850
我的天 你还真是没完没了
My Gods! You're not gonna let it go, are you?

451
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:23,190
求你 能为金女士的儿子验尸吗 看他是怎么死的
Please. Can you do an autopsy on Mrs. King's son to see how he died?

452
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,440
我保证  检查后 我就不管了
I'll let it go. I will. I promise. I will let it go. Just check.

453
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:33,950
我验过了 检查过金女士的儿子
I did. I checked King's son.

454
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,620
梅罗莱克病 他的体内有贝他霉素
Mellorak sickness. He had bittamusin in his system.

455
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,120
行了吗?  收手吧
All right? Now that's it.

456
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,670
别管这件事了 出去!
Now you just leave it. And get out of here!

457
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,410
医生 我觉得不太舒服
Hey, Doc? I don't really feel so good.

458
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,910
能给我注射一些贝他霉素吗?
Think I can get some of that bittamusin?

459
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,570
谁啊?
ATHENA: Who is it?

460
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,620
赫拉 没事
Hey, Hera. It's okay.

461
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,210
金女士?        你的那位军人朋友杜亚拉
Mrs. King? Your friend, the soldier, Dualla.

462
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,830
她生病了 她去看了医生  然后…
She's sick. She went to the doctor. She went...

463
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,880
慢点说  什么…      不  你听我说
Slow down, slow down. What? No, you listen to me.

464
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,550
今晚又有两名撒纪特恩人 
We lost two more tonight,

465
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,380
在接受那杀人魔的治疗后死掉了
Sagittarons who let that murderer treat them.

466
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,430
你得想想办法
You have to do something.

467
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,340
她来这里干什么?
Excuse me. What is she doing here?

468
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,720
她在那里  女士
GUARD 1: There she is! Ma'am?

469
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,600
你不可以来这里  走吧  快走
You're not supposed to be here. Let's go. Now.

470
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:32,060
抱歉  上尉  他妈的难民  不知道她怎么溜进来的
Sorry, Captain. Frakking refugees. I don't know how she snuck through.

471
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,650
早安  长官
Morning, Sir.

472
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,710
别去 别再折腾了 莎伦  这可是杜亚拉
Don't. Don't even think it. Sharon, it's Dualla.

473
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,090
杜亚拉在下面    她有丈夫
Dualla went down there. She has a husband.

474
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,920
不错 他出去巡逻了
Yeah, and he's out flying CAP.

475
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,800
她不会有事的 她吃了药 就会没事的
She'll be fine. She'll take her meds. She'll be fine.

476
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,560
你知道船上的人都在说什么吗?  你和那些撒纪特恩人
You know what's all over the ship? You and the Sagittarons.

477
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,520
你对他们有求必应
How you might actually be listening to them.

478
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,190
那是我的工作
That's my job.

479
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,270
他们要死了 是因为他们拒绝服药
They're dying because they're refusing medication, Karl.

480
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,900
你想让我视而不见吗?  是吗?
You want me to look the other way. Is that it? Is that it?

481
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,240
我们的女儿没事 这才是最重要的?      不是
Our daughter's fine. That's all that matters? No!

482
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,410
要不然就是 只要大家都讨厌撒纪特恩人
Or is it because as long as everyone hates the Sagittarons,

483
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,280
他们就会暂时忘记你是赛昂人?
they'll forget you're a Cylon for five minutes.

484
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,580
你他妈的给我少说两句
You shut the frak up.

485
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,460
对 我是想让你别去管
Yeah. I want you to look the other way.

486
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,880
我每天都在这艘船上努力拼搏 想让大家接受我
I have to fight every single day on this ship to be accepted.

487
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,260
这件事与你无关 知道吗?
This has nothing to do with you! Okay?

488
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,130
你以为我是那种人?  我成了那种人吗?
You think that's who I am? That's what I've become?

489
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,050
"娶了一个赛昂人的男人" 就算是我的代名词?
That's my defining characteristic? The guy married to a Cylon?

490
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,810
这家伙绝非善类
This guy's dirty.

491
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,690
我看他是个骗子 他在害人
I think he's a liar and I think he's killing people

492
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,400
因为他是一个种族主义的混蛋
because he's a racist son of a bitch.

493
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,570
让开  让开!
Make a hole! Get out of the way!

494
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,080
让开  让开
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

495
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,420
小杜?  小杜?
Dee? Dee?

496
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,090
杜亚拉?
Dualla?

497
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,470
杜亚拉?
Dualla?

498
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,820
不 不  不  不
No. No, no, no, no!

499
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,820
杜亚拉
Dualla. Hey!

500
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,660
你怎么会在这里?
Hey. What are you doing down here?

501
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:57,130
我让罗伯特医生给我开了一些药 结果我就晕了过去
Dr. Robert, he gave me something that kicked the frak out of me.

502
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,710
李在哪?      我们这就去见他 来吧  
Where's Lee? We're gonna go see him. Come on.

503
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,550
带你去见科特尔
Come on. Gotta take you to Cottle.

504
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,260
不用   不  来吧
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

505
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,640
他是个"僵尸手"      我知道  来吧
He's got hands of stone. I know. I know. Come on.

506
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,390
你想干什么?
Hey. What the hell are you doing here?

507
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,810
我要带她走
She's coming with me.

508
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,230
不行 以她的状态哪都去不了
No, she's not. She's in no condition to go anywhere.

509
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,890
我要带她到科特尔那里确诊
I'm taking her to Cottle, just to be sure.

510
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,440
确诊是什么意思?  你给我出去!
What do you mean, be... Hey, hey! Get the hell out of here!

511
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,440
医生  你他妈快给我让道!
Get the frak out of my way, Doctor! Now!

512
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,990
来  走吧
Come on, honey. Come on. No.

513
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,450
警卫!
Security!

514
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,540
阿格森疯了 他要伤害我的病人
Agathon, he's lost it. I don't know. He's hurting one of my patients.

515
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,080
他在毒害她 我要带她去见科特尔
He poisoned her. I'm taking her to Cottle.

516
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,170
叫副官来
ROBERT: Get the XO.

517
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,250
别管我
DUALLA: Leave me alone.

518
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,420
长官  别让科特尔来
Sir. No. Not Cottle.

519
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,960
别管我 
Please just leave me alone! No.

520
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,640
上尉  出了什么事?    别管我
Captain, what's going on, sir? Leave me alone.

521
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,600
上尉!  我想睡觉
Captain! I wanna sleep.

522
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,010
别  别睡  我们得继续走
No, no, no, Dee. Come on, we gotta go.

523
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,510
上尉 她不想走    我们得走
Captain, she doesn't want to go. We gotta go.

524
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,440
长官  她说她不想走      把你的手拿开  中士!
Sir! She says she doesn't want to go! Get your hand off me, Sergeant!

525
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,940
站住 长官
You stand down, sir!

526
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,440
把你的手拿开!
Get your frakking hands off me!

527
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,440
把枪给我拿开
Get your gun out of my face!

528
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,820
冷静
Cool it!

529
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,110
我不知道你在搞什么鬼 或是要向谁炫耀什么
I don't know what kind of a crusade you're on or who you're trying to impress,

530
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,120
但你这么做根本没用
but it seriously is not working.

531
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,040
你在害人 我知道你在害人!
You're killing them, Robert. I know you're doing it.

532
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,950
退后
Stand down!

533
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,210
少
Saul.

534
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,130
你和我说过他人很怪 可你没说他是个危险
You told me he was a flake. You didn't tell me he was dangerous!

535
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,000
妈的  闭嘴!
Shut the frak up!

536
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,550
她的情况怎么样?
How is she?

537
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,390
她服用了镇静剂 但无大碍
She's been sedated. But she's okay.

538
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,560
你不信他的那套鬼话吧?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You don't believe him, do you?

539
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,100
他的妄想症很严重 需要去看医生
He's seriously delusional. He needs help.

540
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,190
对 还不如直接杀了他
Yeah. And we should have given it to him.

541
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
医生
HELO: Doc?

542
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,240
直到几个小时前  我才去核查威利的血样
I didn't check Willie's blood until a couple of hours ago.

543
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,370
在此之前我累得要命 我也承认撒纪特恩人让我心烦
I was exhausted, and I'll admit the Sagittarons annoy the hell out of me.

544
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,750
我又不想和我同事对着干
And I didn't want to go against my colleague.

545
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,580
但那些病历的事 西洛说得对
But you were right about their records, Helo.

546
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,710
金女士儿子的体内  根本没有贝他霉素
There was no bittamusin in the King boy's body.

547
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,630
他死了是因为来得太晚了    不  才不是
He died because it was too late. No, he didn't.

548
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,170
他的死因是急性细胞损伤
He died of acute cell destruction.

549
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,680
他被注射了有毒的二磷酸盐
He was injected with a toxic bisphosphonate.

550
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,510
你的诊断明显有误
Now, obviously, you got a wrong reading here.

551
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,430
我不知道这些人还有…    没有!
Now I don't know what else these people... No!

552
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,850
那个老头  巴克明斯特先生的死因也是如此
The old man, Mr. Buckminster, died of the same thing.

553
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,100
他的体内也没有贝他霉素
There was no bittamusin in his system.

554
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,690
是你害死了他们  你他妈的死变态
You killed them, you sick frak.

555
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,990
你应该跪下来  感谢我救了你的女儿
You ought to be on your knees, thanking me for saving your daughter's life,

556
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,330
感谢我还留着药  来为她治病
for having the meds to cure her of her illness.

557
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,460
你也清楚  这种病的晚期有多痛苦
Now you know how painful this disease is at the end.

558
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,000
如果他们不需要我们的帮助
And they don't want our help.

559
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,630
为什么我们还要 浪费时间  空间和药物
Now, why waste time and meds and space on them

560
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:50,380
而不把这些资源给那些真正需要它们的人?
when all of those resources could go to those who really deserve it?

561
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,470
当药物不够用的时候 又该给谁
Who gets the medication when there's not enough to go around?

562
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,551
撒纪特恩人连对自己的种族
A Sagittaron who won't even raise a finger

563
00:39:55,552 --> 00:39:57,720
或一名驾驶员都不愿出手相助
 to save his own race, or a Viper pilot?

564
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:01,230
那"救死扶伤"又是怎么回事  医生?
What the hell happened to "Do no harm," Doctor?

565
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:04,770
我之所以卷了进来  是因为必须有人敢下狠心
Look, I intervened because someone has to make the tough choices here.

566
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,070
但这已经不重要了
But it doesn't matter.

567
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:10,110
不重要了 因为你看看他们  反正他们都会毁了自己
It doesn't matter because, look at them, they're gonna destroy themselves anyway.

568
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,860
看看他们  看看他们站在那里
I mean, look at them. Look at them out there.

569
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:17,160
他们像是待宰的羔羊
They're like worms crawling on a hot rock.

570
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,000
还记得你以前常说什么吗  少?
Remember what you used to say, Saul?

571
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:27,960
除了赛昂人 还有比撒纪特恩人更让你厌恶的东西吗?
Aside from a Cylon, is there anything that you hate more than a Sagittaron?

572
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,880
让我告诉你我讨厌什么  麦克  犯错误
I'll tell you what I hate, Mike. Being wrong.

573
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,430
阿格森上尉   是 长官
Captain Agathon. Sir.

574
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,930
把这狗娘养的给我逮起来 如果有必要 就给他戴上嚼子
Arrest this son of a bitch. Gag him if you have to.

575
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,650
乐意至致  长官
My pleasure, sir.

576
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,110
我没害她
I didn't harm her.

577
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,700
对  她是一个好人
Right. She's one of the good ones.

578
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,340
长官 你找我?
Sir. You wanted to see me?

579
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,050
对  上尉  请坐
Yes, Captain. Please, sit down.

580
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,320
仇恨以及对仇恨的置若罔闻
There's hate and there's allowing hate.

581
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,360
其实是同一枚硬币的正反两面
Two sides of the same coin, really.

582
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,410
两者都负有责任
We're guilty of both.

583
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,620
我们在某处迷失了
Somewhere we got lost.

584
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,580
只留你在荒原中独自前行
You being the lone voice in the wilderness,

585
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,840
而我们却还要向前走一段时间
we were bound to stay that way for a while.

586
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,050
这是我的战舰
This is my ship.

587
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,430
我应该向你道歉
And I owe you an apology.

588
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,560
没必要这么做  长官
That's not necessary, sir.

589
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,470
纵然如此...
All the same,

590
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,480
你依旧雄姿英发
you still have it.

591
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,480
没事了  上尉
That'll be all, Captain.
