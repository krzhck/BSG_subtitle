1
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,440
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》 前情提要
BALTAR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,900
我  莎伦・阿格森  作为殖民舰队军官
I, Sharon Agathon, will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors

3
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,690
将执行上级的命令
as an officer in the Colonial Fleet.

4
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,320
祝贺你  少尉
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

5
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,660
我们在谈论的是那些把自己炸成碎片的人们
I'm talking about people blowing themselves up.

6
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,443
我已经在这里找到了工作
I've got one job here,

7
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:41,540
女士 也是唯一的工作 就是瓦解赛昂人
 lady, and one job only, to disrupt the Cylons,

8
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,830
让他们对任他们摆布的蝼蚁感到恐惧
make them worry about this anthill they've stirred up down here,

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,090
他们会转移注意力 当老头子回来时 会躲过他们的视线
so they're distracted and out of position when the old man shows up in orbit.

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,550
你们也知道了任务
You know the mission.

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,880
你们也该知道这次任务只能以一种方式结束
You should also know there's only one way this mission ends,

12
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,970
那就是从新卡布里卡成功营救我们的人民
and that's with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica.

13
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,340
从整个设施中撤离   
Evacuate the entire facility.

14
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:03,390
你也应该和我们一起走 盖尤斯 我们也给你留了个位置
 You should go as well, Gaius. There's a place for you, too.

15
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,890
上尉 嘿 这是谁?
Captain? Hi. Who's this?

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,100
这是…
This is...

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,310
凯西
Kacey.

18
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,780
噢  我的乖女儿
Oh, my little girl!

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,860
当赛昂人带走她的时候  我以为…
When the Cylons took her, I thought...

20
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,570
但你救了她
But you saved her.

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,990
神保佑你
Gods bless you.

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,200
嗨
Hey.

23
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,910
很多好人都付出了代价 为他们所做的
A lot of good people had to pay the price for what they did,

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,590
他们在新卡布里卡所做的决定 就像我的老婆
the choices they made on New Caprica, like my wife.

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,550
没错  艾伦通了敌
That's right. Ellen collaborated.

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,880
把地下抵抗组织的信息透露给了赛昂人 她付出了生命的代价
She gave the Cylons information on the resistance and she died for it.

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,260
我简直不能想象还有人在质疑我的价值
I can't believe there's still a question of my value.

28
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,140
那肯定会是个问题的
There will always be a question.

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,850
你是一个人类
You're human.

30
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,740
很高兴见到你
BALTAR: Good to see you.

31
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,540
我很喜欢这些风景来作为我们会面的背景 你喜欢吗?
I far prefer these picturesque settings for our little interludes, don't you?

32
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,710
我还以为你把我抛弃给了你的赛昂人伙伴呢
I thought you'd abandoned me to your Cylon comrades.

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,710
我该那么做吗?
NO. 6: Would I do that?

34
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,800
你一直都比你的实体副本…
BALTAR: You've always been more unpredictable

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,670
更难以预知
than your flesh-and-blood counterparts.

36
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,640
一个像你一样恋爱经历丰富的男人
NO. 6: A man that loves women as much as you

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,050
早就应该明白这些了吧
should have learned that a long time ago.

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,310
我学得比较迟钝
I'm a slow learner.

39
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,310
那就把这段当作 
Then take this period as a time to learn

40
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,650
了解什么是赛昂人的经历吧
all you can about the Cylons.

41
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,020
你以后会用得到的
You'll need it in the days ahead.

42
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,980
有什么特殊的地方吗?
Something special on the horizon?

43
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,240
赛昂人的心理活动是基于心理投射
Cylon psychology is based on projection.

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,360
心理投射?
Projection?

45
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,080
那是他们观察周围环境的方法
It's how they choose to see the world around them.

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,660
唯一的不同是你选择了看到我
The only difference is you choose to see me.

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,040
那你是谁呢?
What are you?

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,250
是真实的吗?
Really?

49
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,510
你是我与卡布里卡上所认识的那个女人的连线(结果)
You're either connected to the woman I knew on Caprica,

50
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,800
还是我下意识在努力自我表现的一部分?
or you're a damaged part of my subconscious

51
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,430
你到底是哪一个?
struggling for self-expression, so which one is it?

52
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,310
我是上帝派来帮你的天使
I'm an angel of God sent here to help you,

53
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,020
正如我过去一直所做的
just as I always have been.

54
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,950
我们同是一个巨大生态系统中的一部分
We're all part of one big ecosystem.

55
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,960
是的  我能感觉到它在     呼吸
Yes, I can feel it. Breathing.

56
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,630
要习惯
Get used to it.

57
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,260
呃  他怎么说?
So, what'd he say?

58
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,720
我还没问呢
I haven't asked him yet.

59
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,350
问我什么?
Ask me about what?

60
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,140
地球
Earth.

61
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,600
呃…
Well...

62
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,850
地球 第13个殖民星球
Earth, it's the Thirteenth Colony.

63
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,110
知道怎么找到它吗?
Do you know how to find it?

64
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,320
不太清楚  不
Not really, no.

65
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,450
那  这就太不幸了
D'ANNA: Well, that's unfortunate.

66
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,660
如果你知道去地球的方法 还有一线希望
There was a hope, my hope, that if you knew the way to Earth,

67
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,290
那能确保让你活得更久一些
it would justify keeping you alive a little longer.

68
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,290
走吧  6号
Come on, Six.

69
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,290
等等 等下  等下!
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

70
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,750
我说我不知道地球的具体位置
Now, when I say that I do not know exactly where Earth is,

71
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,413
并不意味我不知道
that is not to say that I do not know 

72
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:05,970
大量关于地球大概位置的信息
a very great deal about its probable location

73
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,368
坦白地说  我花了多少小时 多少天 
Honestly, I spent hours, days, 

74
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,300
多少周  多少月嗯是多少个月
weeks, months and months on a map

75
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,470
在阿达玛和罗丝琳从科波发现的地图上
that Adama and Roslin found on Kobol.

76
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,730
并且我将它们与天体测量联系起来
And I correlated that with our astrometric observations.

77
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,150
我怀疑这里是否有人能做这些
I doubt anyone here can make the same claim.

78
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,110
我们会回来找你的
We'll get back to you.

79
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,070
你们要知道地球干吗?
What do you care about finding Earth?

80
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,950
因为我们在找它
Because we're looking for it.

81
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,950
你们?
You are?

82
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,500
是的  我们决定把地球当作 我们的新家
Yes. We've decided that Earth is going to be our new home.

83
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,150
现授权可以进行一对一的飞船训练 你们准备好以后就开始
HELO: Ship-to-ship training exercise is authorized. You may commence when ready.

84
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,400
这里是阿波罗 红队已准备好
This is Apollo. Red Team set.

85
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,990
蓝队已准备好
KAT: Blue Team set.

86
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,040
红队 阿波罗
Red Team, Apollo.

87
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,250
当我们穿过这颗卫星 我们就会出现在他们的雷达上
As soon as we clear the moon we're gonna be on their dradis,

88
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,540
所以说  大家都打起精神
so keep your eyes up.

89
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,330
他们会全力进攻我们的
They're gonna hit us with everything they've got.

90
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,300
保持编队 星芭  Narcho 你做我的僚机
APOLLO: Stay in formation, Starbuck. Narcho, you're my wingman.

91
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,800
蓝队  凯特  让我们教一下那些懒家伙该怎么开飞机
Blue Team, Kat. Let's show these lazy fraks how it's done.

92
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,930
红队 星芭 我发现了热狗
Red Team, Starbuck. I've got Hotdog.

93
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,940
我被击中!
I'm hit!

94
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,200
红队 阿波罗 我在追踪凯特
Red Team, Apollo. I'm going after Kat.

95
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,820
凯特…
Kat...

96
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,710
你就这种水平吗  阿波罗  再来啊
You're gonna have to do better than that, Apollo! Come on!

97
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,170
我来对付凯特
STARBUCK: I'll take care of Kat.

98
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,380
星芭 你要保持队形!  Narcho在追击凯特
APOLLO: Starbuck, you stay in formation. Narcho has Kat.

99
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,420
归航
Inbound.

100
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,390
星芭 你太近了
APOLLO: Starbuck, you're too close!

101
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,600
哦！
STARBUCK: Oh!

102
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,560
靠!
Frak!

103
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,310
压缩机挂了 看起来像被东西刮了
A compressor blew. It looks like it threw a blade.

104
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,070
供油线路被碰坏了 凯莉  查下油箱      天啊
It severed the fuel line. Cally, check the tank! Gods this is ugly.

105
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,820
油箱都空了 这里都没有任何燃料
The tank's bone-dry. There's not even fumes in here.

106
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,160
上尉  你是怎么降落的?
TYROL: Captain, how'd you land this thing?

107
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,320
将它对准甲板  在我到那的时候就停下来
Pointed it toward the deck and stopped when I got here.

108
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,250
都漏光了  她说   把没有一点燃料的"小鸟"飞回来了
"Bone-dry," she says. Landed the bird without a drop of fuel.

109
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,380
如果你想死 你可以去减压舱
If you want to die, I will open up an airlock for you.

110
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,500
但你不能连累我的其中一架蝮蛇机和你一起完蛋!
But you are not taking one of my Vipers with you.

111
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,420
"小鸟"在甲板上  我也在甲板上
The "bird's" on the deck. I'm on the deck.

112
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,590
我不知道你还在吠什么
I don't know what you're bitching about.

113
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,090
我不会原谅你的所作所为  星芭
I don't give a frak what you do, Starbuck.

114
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,930
你被停飞了
You're done flying.

115
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,790
不能想象你会那样对我
ELLEN: I can't believe you did that to me.

116
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,000
什么?
What?

117
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,710
不要这样看着我
Don't look at me like that.

118
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,250
噢  我的天
Oh, my Gods.

119
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,210
艾伦?
Ellen?

120
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,090
艾伦?
Ellen!

121
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,260
请让让  请让路  让让
Excuse me. Move ahead, make a hole.

122
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,100
请让让
Excuse me.

123
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,730
艾伦
Ellen?

124
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,700
我不是跟你说过了吗 我跟你说了上千次了吧
WOMAN: If I've told you once, I've told you 1,000 times...

125
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,240
艾伦  我在这儿
Ellen! I'm right here!

126
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,450
你是谁?放开我
What is this? Let go of me.

127
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,130
卡拉  卡拉!
KACEY: Kara! Kara!

128
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,680
凯西?
Kacey?

129
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,260
卡拉  卡拉
Kara! Kara!

130
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,020
瑟瑞丝上尉?  对不起  你不认识我了吗?
Captain Thrace? I'm sorry, don't you remember me?

131
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,940
我是Julia Prynne  凯西的妈妈
I'm Julia Prynne. I'm Kacey's mom.

132
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,270
当然  当然  我记得
Yeah. Yeah, I remember.

133
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,440
抱抱我
Give me a hug.

134
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,110
我们现在一直都住在
We've been staying over in the,

135
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,770
大家都把那里称作滑油营
well, everyone's calling it "Camp Oil Slick. "

136
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,400
那是飞行甲板的一部分 他们在那搭了帐篷  你听说了吧 难民
Part of the hangar deck and they've put up cots for, you know, refugees.

137
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,990
是的  我听说了
Yeah. Yeah, I heard.

138
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,160
那好  凯西已经喊了好多天要见你
Well, Kacey's been asking to see you for days.

139
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,580
我让人给你捎了信息 我以为你会过来看看
And I sent messages and I thought maybe, you know, you'd come to visit.

140
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,710
我知道你是个好人
You seem like a really nice person,

141
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,500
所以我也跟你说实话
so I'm gonna be honest with you.

142
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,340
我所需要的只是一个两岁大的玩伴
The last thing I need is a two-year-old friend.

143
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,130
同时凯西也确信在她以后生活中不再需要我
And Kacey sure as hell does not need me in her life,

144
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,550
所以请你帮帮忙不要把她再带过来  好吗?
so do us both a favor and do not bring her around here again, okay?

145
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,430
让你妈抱你吧  凯西
Go to your mom, Kace.

146
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,140
好的
Sure.

147
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,230
不好意思  别让我们再打扰了你了
Sorry. Don't let us keep you up.

148
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,230
对不起  宝贝  我们得走了
Sorry, honey, we've got to go.

149
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,990
减下去了
There it goes.

150
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,830
就是
That's that.

151
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,660
看到了吧?
See?

152
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,210
看到了吧  我说过你能行的
See? I told you, you could do it.

153
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,750
你做得非常好
You did great.

154
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,130
我以后不会再胖起来了
Remind me never to let that happen again.

155
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,430
你瘦下来了
You got it, "Slim. "

156
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,630
再也不了
Ever.

157
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,310
我正在重新整理总统波…
I've been trying to reassemble President...

158
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,480
是波塔尔博士所研究的
Doctor Baltar's work on piecing together

159
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,770
关于去地球的路径的资料
the Thirteenth Tribe's path to Earth.

160
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,190
我很好奇  盖塔先生 你为什么会相信
I'm curious. Mr. Gaeta, what is it that you trust

161
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,900
波塔尔博士的研究成果呢?
about Doctor Baltar's research?

162
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,980
你怎么知道这不是他的又一个骗局呢?
How do you know it's not another one of his lies?

163
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,320
如果还有什么波塔尔的事是我所了解的
If there was one thing I learned about Baltar,

164
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,780
那就是他用于自保的极强的技能
it was his extraordinary capacity for self-preservation.

165
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,870
我认为他很想找到地球 因为他想去那里
I think he wanted to find Earth because he wanted to get there.

166
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,500
他的研究进程怎样了?
How far did he get with his research?

167
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,290
呃  如你所见  我在处理他的这些便笺
Well, as you can see, I'm still hacking through his notes,

168
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,500
但看起来他像是在试图
but it appears that he was trying

169
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,960
与我们的天体测量数据联系起来
to correlate our own astrometric readings

170
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,890
用的是我们在科波所发现的星座地图
with the map of constellations we found back on Kobol.

171
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:11,480
并且使用他所选取的在皮提亚圣卷轴上一些特殊的段落
Now apply his findings to certain select passages within the scroll of Pythia.

172
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,020
为什么是皮提亚圣卷轴?
Why the scroll of Pythia?

173
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,850
皮提亚被认为记载了
Pythia is supposed to have chronicled the original journey

174
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,860
去第13部落的的原始旅程  就是去地球
of the Thirteenth Tribe on its way to Earth.

175
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,530
我想请大家注意这一段
If I can draw your attention to this passage,

176
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,700
"天空中的船队"
"And the caravan of the heavens was watched over by a great lion,

177
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,660
"有着闪耀眼神的狮子"
"with a mighty blinking eye... "

178
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,490
"用它那红色与蓝色的眼神  注视着"
"Red and blue. "

179
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,620
非常对
GAETA: Exactly.

180
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,040
什么对?
Exactly what?

181
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,750
我们在寻找一个狮头?
We're looking for a lion's head?

182
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,420
用闪耀的眼神
With a mighty blinking eye.

183
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,870
闪耀
Blinking.

184
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,250
嗯  那些古圣卷轴  用暗语写的
Well, these scrolls, they speak in metaphors.

185
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,960
开始  我以为博士的思路搞错了  长官
Initially, I thought the doctor might be off his meds as well, sir,

186
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,880
但当我发现了这张纸
but then I found this note, here,

187
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,430
他在上面写了"闪耀的脉冲双星"
where he had written, "Blinking equals pulsar. "

188
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,680
那是一颗星  对吗?
That means a star, right?

189
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,600
唔  双星  事实上  它们在围绕一个死星旋转
Plural, actually. They're the rotating cores of dead stars.

190
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,690
它释放出来的电磁波
They emit a blast of radio waves.

191
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,650
从远处看  看起来像
From a distance, they appear to...

192
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,520
闪耀着的    没错
Blink. Right.

193
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,650
博士发现的就是这两颗互绕星
GAETA: The doctor found two in very close mutual orbit in this sector.

194
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,370
根据这个成果 通过光谱仪分析后 一颗显示的是红色
The spectrographic readings that I found show one will appear to be red

195
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,330
另一颗显示的是蓝色
and one will appear to be blue.

196
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:16,120
现在 这颗脉冲星就是在这片星云里
Now, these pulsars appear to be in this nebula.

197
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,170
我们还从未直接观察过这片区域
We have never had a direct look at this area,

198
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,550
但是  有这种可能  如果有人在那个地方看
but it is possible with a couple of eyeballs out there,

199
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,130
他们就能看到星云和
they might look at the nebula and see...

200
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,760
一只巨大狮子的头
A giant lion's head?

201
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,260
很好  看起来这是我们最好的消息了
Well, it looks like this is the best thing we've got going,

202
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:35,600
呃  如果你不反对  上将  我建议我们去猎狮
so, unless you object, Admiral, I suggest we go lion hunting.

203
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,020
你给我们的导航图好像是有用的
CAPRICA SIX: Navigational markers you gave us may prove useful.

204
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,730
我们派了一艘基地之星去那颗脉冲星
We've sent a Baseship out to investigate the pulsars

205
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,070
去看看你的狮子头
and look for this "lion's head" of yours.

206
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,280
听着  这一切对我并不容易
Look, this isn't easy for me.

207
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,330
我认为你还没有完完全全地感激我 你不知道这一切有多困难
I don't think you fully appreciate just how difficult this is!

208
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,540
我非常矛盾  感觉很痛苦 就是为了帮你找到地球
I have very conflicted, very ambiguous feelings about helping you find Earth.

209
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,670
你表现得真好笑  你那些痛苦的选择  那些内心矛盾
Funny how all that ambivalence and conflict seemed to vanish

210
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,170
当你以为自己的小命快没了的时候
once you thought your life hung in the balance.

211
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,840
你应该知道别人有很多的怀疑
You should know there's still a lot of skepticism

212
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,260
关于我们是否该全信你
about whether you're being entirely truthful.

213
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
呃
Uh.

214
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,690
我很抱歉
Very sorry.

215
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,020
我们不是故意闯进来的
We didn't mean to intrude.

216
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,780
拜托  盖尤斯
Come on, Gaius.

217
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,580
我们在绕圈子吗?
BALTAR: Are we going around in circles?

218
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,960
我知道你看起来这些感觉都一样 不是吗?
CAPRICA SIX: Sure it all looks the same to you, doesn't it?

219
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,500
人类在这里是找不到路的 尤其是没有心理投射
It'd be hard for any human to navigate around here, especially without projecting.

220
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,380
是  你曾经对我说过的
Yes. You've used that word before.

221
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,170
我还不敢肯定你说的是什么
I'm not quite sure what you're talking about.

222
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,470
它能帮你干什么  确切地说?
It helps you to what, exactly?

223
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,390
你是否曾做过白日梦
Have you ever daydreamed?

224
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,220
并想象你正身处某处?
You know, imagined that you were somewhere else?

225
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,890
我确实有过这样的经历
I do have an active imagination.

226
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,100
好  我们不需要想象  我们投影背景
Well, we don't have to imagine. We project.

227
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,020
我们可以选择希望见到的背景 在任何时候 以任何形式
We choose to see our environment in any form we wish, whenever we wish.

228
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,610
比方说  现在你看到我们正在一个走廊里走动
For instance, right now, you see us as standing in a hallway,

229
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,690
但我看它是一座森林
but I see it as a forest.

230
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,030
充满了树木  鸟类和阳光
Filled with trees, birds, sunlight.

231
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,120
就像我们过去在卡布里卡上散步
Like walks you and I used to take on Caprica.

232
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,790
是我的审美让我愉快
The aesthetic is what gives me pleasure,

233
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,840
不是什么特殊的记忆
not the specific memories.

234
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,600
为了替换周围的空墙
Instead of staring at blank walls,

235
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,510
我选择如同神造般的景象作我周围的背景
I choose to surround myself with a vision of God's creation.

236
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,690
现在我理解投影的意思了
BALTAR: Right. I think I understand projection,

237
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,190
但那是否同步的?
but, it's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?

238
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,530
我可以看到自己创造的生动的画面
That I could see such... a vivid reality that I've created

239
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,660
赛昂人投影的经历看起来与我的很相似？
and the Cylon projection experience seems to be so similar?

240
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,780
是不是同步的?
Is it a coincidence?

241
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,370
你说什么?
Well, what are you saying?

242
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,460
这有联系吗?
There's a connection?

243
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,790
什么  因为我和你在一起的经历
What, because of my experiences with you...

244
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,630
我是赛昂人?
Am I a Cylon?

245
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,960
你说什么?
What was that?

246
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,180
噢  没什么只是声音大了点
Oh, nothing. Just... Just talking out loud.

247
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,640
愚蠢的我
Silly me.

248
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,030
那你还想做我的副驾驶吗?
ATHENA: So, are you sure you want to go in second seat again?

249
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,820
我的意思是 我听说你现在是非常好的飞行员
I mean, I hear you're a pretty fair pilot now.

250
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,990
嗯  驾驶员太多了  战机却不够
Yeah, well, too many pilots, not enough birds.

251
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,830
现在  任何能让我飞行的机会
Anything to keep me flying at this point.

252
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,750
你会需要我的  我跟你  布玛尔
You want me, I'm yours, Boomer.

253
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,880
哦  不  布玛尔是...  她不是我
No, Boomer was... She was someone else.

254
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,930
大家听好了 我们要给阿格森少尉起个外号
Listen up! We need a call sign for Lieutenant Agathon!

255
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,640
郭文!    泰坦尼亚
Chromedome! MAN 2:Titania!

256
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,640
猛禽    发条
WOMAN 1: Raptor Adaptor. WOMAN 2: Windup Toy.

257
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,810
罐头    害虫杀手
Tin Can! Vermin Chaser!

258
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,140
雏鸟
MAN 3: Micro Chick.

259
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,390
叫雅典娜怎样?
HOTDOG: How about "Athena"?

260
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,520
信息女神
MAN 4: "Digital Dame. "

261
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,190
等  等  等  等  那是什么呢?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What was that?

262
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,690
你知道的  那是掌管智慧和战争的女神
You know, the goddess of wisdom and war,

263
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,780
经常陪伴在胜利女神旁边的
usually accompanied by the goddess of victory.

264
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,950
就是它了    很贴切
MAN 5: It works out. MAN 6: She likes it.

265
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,490
那就是雅典娜
Athena it is.

266
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,990
就它了    对 没错
MAN 7: So be it. MAN 8: Okay, deal.

267
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,660
好 你获得这个称号了  还要些什么?
MAN 10: All right, you got that. You want some more?

268
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,790
嘿  上校!  上校  过来坐坐
KAT: Hey, Colonel! Colonel, come have a seat. Over here.

269
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,790
还没玩够吗?
Enough of that to go around?

270
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,550
不会的   哦 是啊
Always. Oh, yeah.

271
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,260
聚魂箱 "杀人"的游戏  不是你的风格嘛
"Deadman's Chest," cutthroat game. Not usually your style.

272
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,060
现在是了 并且我还要赢呢
It is now. And I'm in it to win.

273
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,970
你不喜欢  那就找其他游戏吧
If you don't like it, find another game.

274
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,390
噢  有一些实话要说呢
Now there's some straight talk.

275
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,600
你们没有看到外面排的队吗?
You see the line up outside the head?

276
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,530
15个平民在排队  捏着鼻子
15 civilians standing in line, picking their noses,

277
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,530
等着洗澡
waiting to take a shower.

278
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,410
那帮该死的家伙以为是他们在操作飞船呢
Frakking civilians think they run the ship now.

279
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,490
相比过去  飞船现在像个坟墓
Beats who we had before. Ship was like a tomb.

280
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,330
你想知道孤独是什么感觉吗?
You want to know what "alone" feels like,

281
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,370
那就去赛昂人监狱里待上几周吧
try spending a few weeks in a Cylon holding cell.

282
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,080
是啊  那都是狗屎
Yeah. It was a bitch on both sides.

283
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,670
可拯救你们这些可怜的家伙也不是件容易的事情
It wasn't exactly easy coming up with a plan to save your sorry butts.

284
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,750
你这家伙还不满足  嗯?
Yeah, you guys had it rough, huh?

285
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,380
热水澡  一日三餐
Hot showers, three squares a day.

286
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,010
直到你们跳进轨道 蝮蛇机里的勇士们甚至没开一枪
Viper jocks didn't even take a shot until you jumped into orbit.

287
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,350
我们都有牺牲
Hey. We all made sacrifices.

288
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,640
是那样吗?
That so?

289
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,930
是  那是真的
Yes, that's right.

290
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,520
在你给你的赛昂女朋友佩带飞行章的时候
While you were pinning wings on your Cylon girlfriend,

291
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,060
我们的人正在把自制炸弹绑在胸前
our people were strapping homemade bombs to their chests,

292
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,820
尽可能地将赛昂人轰出去
doing whatever they could to take the bastards out.

293
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,740
所以请原谅我不认同你所说的牺牲
So forgive me if I don't get all misty over your sacrifices.

294
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,750
你看起来心不在焉  盖尤斯
CAPRICA SIX: You seem distracted, Gaius.

295
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,540
我没事
I'm fine.

296
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,300
你可以休息下了  至少现在
You can rest easy, at least for now.

297
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,130
地球位置的资料 还有你勇敢地把那个婴儿救了出来
Data on Earth's location and your valiant rescue of the baby

298
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,720
已经给了其他人一个很深的印象
has gone a long way toward impressing the others.

299
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,440
我一直在想某天能与你生个孩子
I used to think you and I would have a baby one day.

300
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,820
只有12个人形赛昂
There are only 12 Cylon models.

301
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,780
但在新卡布里卡我只看到了七个
But in the entire occupation on New Caprica I only saw seven.

302
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,780
这里也一样  同样的7个赛昂人
Now, here again, the same seven.

303
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,820
另外五个呢?
Who are the Final Five?

304
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,120
我不能说那个
I can't talk about that.

305
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,870
是不能还是不想?     我不能
Can't or won't? I can't.

306
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,580
这很复杂  但我们从不谈论他们
It's complicated. But we don't talk about them, ever.

307
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,000
但你应该认识他们中的一个  不是吗?
But you'd know one of them, wouldn't you,

308
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,460
当你看到这五个赛昂人中的一个
if you saw them, one of the Final Five

309
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,340
假如他们从你身旁走过的时候
if they were to walk past here, right?

310
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,170
6号  我们遇到麻烦了
Six, we have a problem.

311
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,680
那艘基地之星 就是我们派过去调查狮子星云中脉冲星的那艘
A Baseship, the one we sent to investigate the pulsars in the Lion nebula,

312
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,560
我们失去了联络
we've lost contact.

313
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,100
麻烦就在于我们几乎不知道失踪的这艘基地之星的所有状态
The trouble is, we know almost nothing about the missing Baseship's status.

314
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,690
我们收到一个混乱的求救信号 然后就没有消息了
We received a garbled distress call, then silence.

315
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,280
不过  他们的混合体向我们发送了一组被混乱了的数据
Not surprisingly, their Hybrid sent us a confusing set of data.

316
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,570
我们的混合体正在研究它
Our Hybrid is analyzing it.

317
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,110
他所说的混合体是什么?
What are these Hybrids he's talking about?

318
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,660
安静  盖尤斯
Be quiet, Gaius.

319
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,010
我们的混合体正在解译
NO. EIGHT: Our Hybrid's deciphered part of the data set

320
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,840
由我们侦查机捕获的数据
that we received from our scout ship.

321
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,930
这不该发生在我们身上 这不可能
DORAL: This can't happen to us. It's impossible.

322
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,390
不是不可能
SIMON: It is not only possible,

323
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,720
这可能是不可避免的  当我们进化成人形
it may have been inevitable once we took human form.

324
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,480
我们不是人类 我们不像他们
DORAL: We're not human. We're not like him.

325
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,310
上帝选了这个时刻  这个地点来考验我们
LEOBEN: God has chosen this time, this place to test us.

326
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,400
是否能度过这次考验还要靠我们自己
Whether we fail or pass the test is up to us.

327
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
怎么样了?
What is going on?

328
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,780
失踪的基地之星可能感染了某种病毒
The missing Baseship, it's been infected with some kind of disease.

329
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,990
病毒?
Disease?

330
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,410
是的  正在杀死他们  所有人
Yes. It's killing them. All of them.

331
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,346
如果一个感染的赛昂人死亡
If an infected Cylon dies and carries 

332
00:20:53,347 --> 00:20:55,500
把病毒带着一起返回了复活船
this disease with them into a Resurrection ship,

333
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,790
那可能会快速蔓延 有可能威胁到我们整个族群
it could rapidly spread, potentially infecting our entire race.

334
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,250
好的  我们要确保复活船在安全距离外
All right. We make sure that the Resurrection ship is out of range,

335
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,920
然后我们跳跃到那里
then we jump to their location,

336
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,510
派出一队赛昂武士
send in a group of Centurions to...

337
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,090
不  数据显示在混合体被感染的时候
No. The data set indicates that as soon as their Hybrid was infected,

338
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,390
赛昂武士就开始关闭
their Centurions started shutting down.

339
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,010
我们不能确认我们的是否会被感染
We don't know how ours are gonna be affected.

340
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,140
我想我们的突袭机和基地之星也会被感染的
I assume our Raiders and Baseships are also susceptible.

341
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,940
当然了 我们都是由同一基因池所创造的
Of course. We are all created from the same genetic pool.

342
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,730
没有一个赛昂人能不被感染地登上那艘船
Then no Cylon can board that ship without risking infection.

343
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,450
去说你能登上那艘感染的基地之星
Say you'll go aboard the infected Baseship

344
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,280
并调查发生了什么
and investigate what happened.

345
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,490
是你把他们派去那片星云的 记得吗?
You sent them to that nebula, remember?

346
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,870
你疯了啊?
Are you mad?

347
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,670
你要证明给他们看 你在这种紧急情况下是派得上用场的
You have to prove to them you can be counted on in an emergency.

348
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,460
告诉他们你的存在是有价值的
Show them you're worth keeping alive.

349
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,300
那如果我也感染了病毒呢?
And what if I catch the disease?

350
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,800
一个人感染赛昂武士与突袭机的病 
What are the chances that a human could catch something

351
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,260
这机会有多大呢?
that infects a Centurion or a Raider?

352
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,850
并且  如果你是一个人类  或者说  你是个真正的赛昂人
That is, if you're human. And if you're really a Cylon,

353
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,810
是你从未见过的五个中的一个
one of the Final Five you haven't seen yet,

354
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,230
你会让一切都被毁掉并步入灭亡吗?
then wouldn't you just rather get it over with and die?

355
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,570
我去
I'll go.

356
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,740
什么?
What?

357
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,620
是的  我去
Yes, I'll go.

358
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,540
听着  我是一个训练有素的科学家  我可以去基地之星
Look, I am a trained scientist. I can go to the Baseship.

359
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,630
我可以对赛昂人进行观察 检查他们的身体状况
I can make observations about the Cylons, their physical condition,

360
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,920
带回关于那些让你们都在恐惧的病毒的信息
bring back information about this disease which now threatens all of you.

361
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,510
我们已知这种病毒能杀死人形赛昂
We've learned the disease that's killing the human Cylons

362
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,510
也能感染我们的突袭机
could infect one of our Raiders as well.

363
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,680
那就不要派突袭机
Then don't send a Raider.

364
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,760
战争中你们肯定有遗留下某些殖民地的飞船
Surely, the war's furbished you with some Colonial vessels?

365
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,770
他是对的 我们可以设定一驾猛禽机为自动导航飞到那儿
He's right. We could program one of our Raptors to approach on autopilot.

366
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,770
好的  那就准备跳跃
All right, then, prepare to jump the ship.

367
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,360
要确保复活船留在后面  保持安全距离
Make sure the Resurrection ship knows to stay behind, out of range.

368
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,450
多么无私的行动
A truly selfless act.

369
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,500
倒进我这里吧
Hey, I could use a refill here.

370
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,420
你该知道 
Here's to knowing

371
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,640
很多人一直在支持你
that somebody will always have your back!

372
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,140
这个观点没错  但在我脑子里
The sentiment's good, but in my book,

373
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,060
信任是价格高昂的日用品
trust is an overrated commodity.

374
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,480
嗯  为它干一杯
That one I'll drink to.

375
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,150
靠  你们这群家伙
Frak you guys.

376
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,900
你有什么问题  凯特瑞恩?
What is your problem, Katraine?

377
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,780
我的问题是你  上尉
My problem is you, Captain.

378
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,200
这都是反对他们的废话
All this "us against them" crap.

379
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,580
事实很残酷  对吧?  再给我一杯
STARBUCK: Truth hurts, doesn't it? Give me another one.

380
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,500
你知道什么  星芭?  不管你在那下面发生了什么
You know what, Starbuck? Whatever happened to you down there,

381
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,920
为何你不把账记在赛昂人头上
why don't you take it out on the Cylons?

382
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,960
因为我们也是使出吃奶的劲去救大家
'Cause we busted our ass to get you off that rock!

383
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,420
你知道那意味着什么吗?
Oh, do you think that means anything?

384
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,840
所有在新卡布里卡上的人员都是忠诚的 无论在哪一个方面
Every colonist that landed on New Caprica was loyal to a point.

385
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,180
我很惊讶地看到一些人
It was amazing watching those people

386
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,100
自以为知道如何反抗赛昂人
that you thought you knew go over to the Cylons.

387
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,930
至少我们知道该怎么做  对吧?
At least, in the end, we knew where we stood, huh?

388
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,850
真如你所说吗?
Is that so?

389
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,650
那为何你在完成飞行任务后
Then how come you are off flight duty

390
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,610
赛昂人的爱人还在占着我的职位?
and some "Cylon-lover" is holding down my post?

391
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,650
别开你自己的玩笑  命是你自己的
Don't kid yourselves. You're on your own in this life,

392
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,280
我们每一个人都是
each and every one of us.

393
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,910
你为何不说说那些战死的机师
KAT: Why don't you tell that to the pilots

394
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,450
为了把你们从星球上营救出来
that died getting you off that rock?

395
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,670
还有盖塔关于莎伦和赛道侦查那颗脉冲星的任务的简报
And Gaeta's briefing Sharon and Racetrack on the scouting mission to the Pulsars.

396
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,000
你的意思是雅典娜与赛道
You mean Athena and Racetrack.

397
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,300
消息传得很快啊
Word travels fast.

398
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,760
是的  确实
Yes, it does.

399
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,720
我理解机师们的士气不高
I understand that morale's taken a hit on the flight deck.

400
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,560
没有什么是我们克服不了的  长官
Nothing we can't handle, sir.

401
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,310
我还被告知泰上校…
I'm also told that Colonel Tigh

402
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,310
花了不少时间在机师娱乐室
is spending a lot of time down in the pilot's rec room.

403
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,270
他和星芭  长官
Both him and Starbuck, sir.

404
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,110
他们组成了一个小圈子 还在对那次救援的事三道四
They've been holding court, second guessing the rescue,

405
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,530
对留在卡拉狄加上的船员没什么口德
badmouthing the crew that stayed up with Galactica.

406
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,660
突然间  正如你这些没参加地面抵抗的人  就不能被信任
Suddenly, if you weren't in the ground war, it's like you can't be trusted.

407
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,950
人们都在听着
And people are listening?

408
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,290
他们的话过头了
Their word carries a lot of weight.

409
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,920
你是对的  他们在打击士气和拉帮结派
You're right, they're destroying morale and unit cohesion.

410
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,040
他们都知道道理的
They both know better.

411
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,090
我不这么认为  长官
I don't think they care, sir.

412
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,310
两个质子在两边分裂 创建力场
HYBRID: Two protons expelled at each coupling site creates them under force.

413
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,310
胚胎已进化到鱼状形态 在A状态前我们不要操作
The embryo becomes a fish that we don't enter until eight plate.

414
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,440
我们在此经历小心翼翼地进化 萎缩
We're here to experience, evolve the little toe, atrophy.

415
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,190
别问我该怎么办 我会在1000光年处死去
Don't ask me how, I'll be dead in 1,000 light years.

416
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,360
谢谢  谢谢  起源转为它的源头
Thank you. Thank you. Genesis turns to its source,

417
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,490
逐步递减 尽管感觉都是一样的
reduction occurs stepwise though the essence is all one.

418
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,240
行终止
End of line.

419
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,370
超光速系统检查  设定诊断功能参数  
FTL system check, diagnostic functions within parameters,

420
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,540
重复执行 痛苦是剧烈的
repeats the harlequin, the agony exquisite,

421
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
颜色沿着尘埃之路行走
the colors run the path of ashes.

422
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,710
52%的热交换机
Neuronal network run 52% of heat exchanger.

423
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,380
联接多维矩阵
Cross-collateralized with hyperdimensional matrix.

424
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,760
优先于修理指令 继电器转到0  0  0  0
Upper sensors repair ordered, relay to zero, zero, zero, zero...

425
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,260
它能感觉到我们吗?
BALTAR: Is it aware of us?

426
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,800
当然 她能感觉到船上的所有东西
CAPRICA SIX: Of course. She's aware of everything aboard.

427
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,310
行终止
HYBRID: End of line.

428
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,720
新的段落
New paragraph.

429
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,280
胰液在进化矩阵的统一体中流动
Reduction occurs stepwise though the essence is all one.

430
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,160
你知道她在说什么吗?
Do you have any idea what it's talking about?

431
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,530
不
No.

432
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,910
绝大多数赛昂人都认为混合体的意识思维已经疯了
Most Cylons think the conscious mind of the Hybrid has simply gone mad

433
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
她所发出的声音对我们来说是无意义的
and the vocalizations we hear are meaningless.

434
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,040
但不是所有人都这么认为
But not everyone thinks that?

435
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,760
你认识的那个李奥本认为
The ones you know as "Leoben"

436
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,720
她口中所说的东西是有含义的
believe that every word out of her mouth means something.

437
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,720
上帝通过她的嘴向我们说话
That God literally speaks to us through her.

438
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,890
她或多或少地控制基地之星  对吧?
She sort of controls the Baseship, does she?

439
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,860
她就是母舰  非常严格地说
Well, she is the Baseship, in a very real sense.

440
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,570
意识疯掉了
A mind gone mad.

441
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,110
她体验生活和我们很不同 盖尤斯
She experiences life very differently than we do, Gaius.

442
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,620
她在天空中游弋
She swims in the heavens,

443
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,700
在星空中欢笑  在宇宙尘埃中呼吸
laughs at stars, breathes in cosmic dust.

444
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,620
也许李奥本是对的
Maybe Leoben's right,

445
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,620
也许她的确能看到上帝
maybe she does see God.

446
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,210
我们在浪费时间
We're wasting time.

447
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,630
跳跃
Jump.

448
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,730
到处都是尸体
There are bodies everywhere.

449
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,320
他们正在死去
Others dying.

450
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,570
这是什么该死的东西?    明显人造的
BALTAR: What the hell is that? Definitely manmade.

451
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,110
你严重脱水 你必须喝点水
You're severely dehydrated. You must drink some water.

452
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,150
杀了我
Kill me.

453
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,910
你不会明白的 这附近没有复活船
You don't understand, there is no Resurrection ship nearby.

454
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,530
你没有机会下载到新的躯体里了 你会就此死去
You will not be downloaded into a new body, you will just be gone.

455
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,410
我看到他们怎么死的了
I saw how they died.

456
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,370
请帮我
Please...

457
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,830
请帮我  我忍受不了了
Please, I can't bear that.

458
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,840
我来这里就是为了帮助你们 好吗?
I'm here to bring help. All right?

459
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,550
我会采一些血样带回基地之星上分析
I'm just gonna take some blood samples for analysis on the Baseship.

460
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,430
到时候我们就有对付病毒的方法了
And then we will be able to make a treatment for the disease.

461
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,560
呼吸  求求你
You must breathe, please.

462
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,020
请你喝点水
Please, take some water.

463
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,480
你是从卡拉狄加上来的
You're... You're from Galactica.

464
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,900
不  我是从基地之星上来的
No. I'm from a Baseship.

465
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,940
告诉我
Tell me,

466
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,660
你知道这是什么吗?
do you know what this is?

467
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,910
我们在附近空间发现它在漂浮
We found it floating at these coordinates.

468
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,170
应该是一种讯标
It must be some kind of

469
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,420
或是记号器
a beacon, a marker.

470
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,050
它看起来很古老了  看起来非常古老
It looks too old. It looks very old.

471
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:34,220
一定是第13部落遗留下来的  它被感染了 有毒的
It must have been left by the Thirteenth Tribe, infected, poisoned,

472
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,060
是被一些像你一样的人类留下来毁灭我们的
left by some humans like you to destroy us.

473
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,520
什么?
What?

474
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,730
一个带着瘟疫的人类设备
A human device filled with a pestilence.

475
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,230
是你把我们派到这里的
You sent us to this place.

476
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,360
那不是我
It wasn't me.

477
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,400
你知道我们会把它拿上舰
You knew we'd bring it aboard.

478
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,900
你不知道你在说什么了
You don't know what you're saying.

479
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,400
这就是你所说的…
This is the disease...

480
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,700
你知道我们会…
You knew we would...

481
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,370
...病毒    冷静 我是来帮助你们的
...speaking for you. Will you calm down! I am going to bring help.

482
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,740
我是来帮助你们的
I am going to bring help.

483
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,790
你想让其他基地之星也来这里
You wanted the other Baseships to follow.

484
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,410
我不会做任何伤害你的事情
I would never do anything to hurt you.

485
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,960
你想让其他的基地之星过来  你知道它在这儿
You wanted the other Baseships. You knew it was here.

486
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,580
我是过来帮助你们的
I am going to bring help.

487
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,130
安静
Be quiet.

488
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,590
受到同样的感染
Suffer the same infection.

489
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,750
安静  我是过来帮助你们的 
Be quiet. I am going to bring help!

490
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
你想把我们都消灭
You want to destroy us all!

491
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,420
都是你的错! 你骗了他们
It your fault! You'll lie to them.

492
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,010
闭嘴!     你骗了他们
Shut up! No, you'll lie to them!

493
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,470
闭嘴   你要把他们都带来..
Shut up! You'll bring them here.

494
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,260
都是你的错    闭嘴
It your fault! Shut up!

495
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,760
安静    不 让我…
Be quiet! No, let me...

496
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,100
闭嘴!
Shut up!

497
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,890
不要让我…        闭嘴!
Don't let me... Shut up!

498
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,070
盖尤斯  听到没有?
DORAL: Gaius, do you hear us?

499
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,160
盖尤斯  收到了吗?  还有人活着吗?
Gaius, do you read? Do you read? Are any of them alive?

500
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,950
盖尤斯・波塔尔 你看到什么了
Gaius Baltar, what do you see?

501
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,330
回话 你看到什么了 还有人活着吗
Speak to us. What do you see? Are any of them alive?

502
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,250
我是盖尤斯・波塔尔
This is Gaius Baltar.

503
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,710
我马上回基地之星
I'm returning to the Baseship.

504
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,340
你看到什么了?
DORAL: What do you see?

505
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,050
我什么都没看到
I see nothing.

506
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,350
没有什么有价值的信息
Nothing of consequence.

507
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,220
这儿没什么可做的了
There's nothing left to do here.

508
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,610
没人愿意这样  但我们必须得冒这个可怕的风险
D'ANNA: Nobody likes it, but we have to make a terrible choice.

509
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,620
试着救援他们 会让我们舰队的同伴们带入危险
Do we attempt a rescue and risk the lives of our fleet,

510
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,870
甚至我们的种族  还是让我们离开他们吧
even our species, or do we leave them?

511
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,500
从科学的角度看 无法找到治愈的办法
The answer won't be found in science because there is no cure in science.

512
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,700
不  肯定有方法的
Well, there has to be.

513
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,460
看看他们  他们如此恐惧  我们就这样离他们而去?
Look at them. They're so afraid. Do we just leave them?

514
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,830
然后宣告他们死亡  绝不行
Then their quest ended in death. Absolutely, no.

515
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,250
即便是人类也不会抛弃他们的袍泽
Even the humans don't abandon their own.

516
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,000
他们必须为了大家而牺牲
DORAL: They must be sacrificed for the greater good.

517
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,300
这是个很好的问题
SIMON: There is a greater question.

518
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,760
是的  就是
Yes, there is.

519
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
为什么会发生这个事情呢?
How did this happen?

520
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:40,180
都是因为波塔尔  都是他的错  他故意把我们引到那里
DORAL: Well, it's Baltar. It's his fault, he led us there deliberately.

521
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,020
他一直都在为卡拉狄加工作!
He been working with Galactica the whole time!

522
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,640
那不是我
It wasn't me.

523
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,600
不论你们怎么看我  老实说  我没做!
Whatever you think I did, I didn't do it, honestly!

524
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,060
波塔尔  我们遵照你给的坐标
Baltar, we followed your coordinates,

525
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,860
结果却得了一种没法医治的疾病
and found a disease with no treatment or cure.

526
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,780
很明显这是他们的命运 不会再回来了
If we leave, they're doomed, never to return.

527
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,570
可能上帝会嘲笑我们 因为我们的仁慈
Perhaps God would smile upon us, for our mercy.

528
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,780
哦  听你的    你也就只能说说别人了
Oh, listen to you. You can barely even speak His name.

529
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,370
我们不得不同意   我们没有抛弃我们的兄弟
D'ANNA: We have to agree. We are not leaving our brothers.

530
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,000
够了
D'ANNA: Enough!

531
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,340
我们必须离开
We have to leave.

532
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,140
我们必须跳跃  让他们去面对自己的命运  没有别的办法
We have to jump and leave them to their fate. There is no other way.

533
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,990
梦想的薄雾顺着初起的回响坠落 不再去爱
Mists of dreams drip along the nascent echo and love no more.

534
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,530
行终止
End of Line.

535
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,700
混合体反对
The Hybrid objects.

536
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,370
她没有投票权
She doesn't get a vote.

537
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,000
马上跳跃
Jump the ship.

538
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,010
跳跃
Jump.

539
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,690
这种病毒
D'ANNA: This disease,

540
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,020
一定是从什么地方过来的
it must have come from someplace.

541
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,360
你在被感染的船上发现了什么吗?
So what did you notice on the infected ship?

542
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,990
没有  没有  我和你一样困惑
BALTAR: Nothing. Nothing. I am just as baffled as you are.

543
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,250
你没发现被感染船上有什么可疑的吗?
You noticed nothing suspicious on the infected ship?

544
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,210
没有什么特别的
Nothing whatsoever.

545
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,850
全体起立
CREWMAN: Admiral on deck!

546
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,390
上将
TIGH: Admiral.

547
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,350
给我让一让
Give me the room.

548
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,520
坐在你的位子上
Stay in your seats.

549
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,530
喝点吗?
Have a drink?

550
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,080
把你的佩枪给我
Give me your sidearm.

551
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,750
什么?
What?

552
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,830
你的佩枪
Your sidearm.

553
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,770
嗨  里面还有一发子弹呢
TIGH: Hey! There's a live round in that!

554
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,360
你们和我都不怕它
Now, one of you, and I don't care who,

555
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,780
拾起武器  朝我开枪
pick that weapon up and shoot me.

556
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,870
上将  我不知道…
Admiral, I don't know...

557
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,450
我没说让你讲话
I didn't say to talk.

558
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,040
你也已经说的够多的了
You've done enough of that already.

559
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,880
我说拾起武器 朝我开枪
I said to pick up that weapon and shoot.

560
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,170
怎么了?
What's the matter?

561
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,510
没胆了?
No guts?

562
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,640
你们不是一对吗?
You don't got a pair?

563
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,390
你们两个都是他妈的胆小鬼
You're both frakking cowards.

564
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,430
管好你的嘴         要不呢?
Watch your mouth... Or what?

565
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,270
你让我们剩下的机师互相敌对吗?
You gonna turn the rest of my pilots against each other?

566
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,310
毒害我们的船员?
Poison the crew?

567
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,570
你已经这么做了  少  你们都是
You've already done that, Saul. Both of you.

568
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,780
是啊  如果你希望得到我们的道歉  那是没有的
Yeah, but if you're looking for an apology, it isn't gonna happen.

569
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,950
你过去就像我的女儿一样
You were like a daughter to me once.

570
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,330
不再是了
No more.

571
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:36,080
你是个散布不满的人  是个毒瘤
You're a malcontent and a cancer,

572
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,460
我不想让你待在我的船上
and I won't have you on my ship.

573
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,800
你现在有个机会
So you have a choice.

574
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,180
要么你明白该怎样做人 怎样做个军官
You can figure out how to become a human being again and an officer,

575
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,760
要么你找个别的地方去生活 离开这艘船
or you can find another place to live off of this ship.

576
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,270
解散
You're dismissed.

577
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,480
你也准备把我从位子上踢下来吗?
Are you gonna kick me out of my chair, too?

578
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,490
听着  我知道你经历了很多
Listen, I know you've been through a lot...

579
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,990
别教育我
Don't patronize me.

580
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,860
说些什么教育我的话
Say what you came here to say.

581
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,160
你满肚子都是怒火 仇恨
You're full of bile. Hatred.

582
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,080
我知道这和艾伦有关 对这件事情我也很抱歉
And I know that it has something to do with Ellen, and I'm sorry for that.

583
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,790
如果你需要时间  少  你可以随便花多长时间
And if you need time, Saul, well, you take all the time you want.

584
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,800
但我要管理整艘船
But I got to run a ship.

585
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,430
我不能忍受一个独眼的醉鬼在这儿坐着  
The last thing I need is a one-eyed drunk sitting down here,

586
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,760
还散播不满和反抗情绪
sowing discontent and disobedience.

587
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,890
所以我再跟你说一次  少
So I'll tell you once again, Saul.

588
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,810
你可以把武器拾起来  朝我开枪
You can pick up that weapon and kill me,

589
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,320
或是把你的屁股挪回你的地方并且不要再离开
or you can get your ass back into your quarters and not leave

590
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,070
直到你表现得像我在过去30年里认识的那个男人
until you're ready to act like the man that I've known for the past 30 years.

591
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,840
那个人不会再存在了  比尔
That man doesn't exist anymore, Bill.

592
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,430
你也不会再见到我了
And you won't be seeing me again.

593
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,810
对 那是我和他共事的原因
MAN 1: Yeah, that's why I work with him.

594
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,270
那就是我要说的
MAN 2: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

595
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,700
再拿条毛巾给我
MAN 3: Grab another towel for me.

596
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,030
我们要过去了
Yeah, we got to get up there.

597
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,490
好
MAN 4: All right.

598
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,430
噢  我的天  它就在这里
Oh, my Gods, it's right there.

599
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,430
狮头星云  还有闪耀的眼睛
The Lion's Head nebula and the Blinking Eye.

600
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,350
我们的赌注  那是通往地球的道路
Holy crap, it's the road to Earth.

601
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,540
噢  我的天  让我们离开这鬼地方
Oh, my Gods! Let's get the frak out of here.

602
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,410
我来准备跳跃
I'll start the jump.

603
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,220
当神愤怒起来 巨人也会倒下
When Gods' anger awakens, even the mighty shall fall.

604
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,800
靠!  雅典娜  我们得离开这里
Frak! Athena, we need to get out of here!
