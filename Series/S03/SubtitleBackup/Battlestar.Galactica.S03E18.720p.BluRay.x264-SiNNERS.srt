She's looking for someone to take charge of the preliminaries,

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,390

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,680
这是我爷爷写的法律书   你爸爸给你的
APOLLO: These are my grandfather's law books. DUALLA: It's from your father.

15
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,600
星芭  我是阿波罗  我在雷达上找不到你
Starbuck, Apollo. I've lost you on dradis.

KELLY: Viper Six, LSO. Viper approved.

55
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,100
没想到我会怀念星芭的伶牙俐齿
Never thought I'd miss all of Starbuck's yakking.

56
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,400
是啊  长官
Yes, sir.

57
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,940
恭喜了
Your Honor.

58
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,320
你没听到
You haven't heard?

59
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,660
你去哪了? 他们刚刚公布  你中奖了
Where you been? They just announced it. You won the lottery.

60
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,910
波塔尔五分之一的小贱命就掌握在你手里了
You now own exactly one-fifth of Baltar's skinny ass.

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,040
法官席上审判波塔尔的五名船长当中 有你一个
You're one of five Captains picked to serve on the judge's tribunal.

62
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,250
嗯
Hmm.

63
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,220
他来了
Here he comes.

64
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,220
妈的
Frak.

65
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,687
运送波塔尔的律师
It's a waste of my time 

66
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:55,810
在和风号之间飞来飞去是浪费时间和精力
and energy flying Baltar's lawyer back and forth from Zephyr.

67
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,480
跟我说说具体的  知道最糟糕的是什么吗?
Yeah, tell me about it. Wanna know what the worst part is?

68
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,650
他就坐在我后面 还凑上来想跟我说悄悄话
He sits back there and tries to whisper into my ear when he talks.

69
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,320
我还戴着头盔呢  不好意思
I've got a helmet. Sorry.

70
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,280
休斯先生
Mr. Hughes.

71
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,410
他要是再在我的猛禽号里脱鞋子 我也许会杀了他
He takes his shoes off in my Raptor again, I might have to kill him.

72
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,040
当事人 谁都知道他有罪 他把我们的位置告诉了赛昂人
Client. Everybody knows he's guilty. He gave the Cylons our location.

73
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,960
还审那狗娘养的干吗?
Why even give the son of a bitch a trial?

74
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,800
因为他有权利
Because he's entitled.

75
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,380
即使是他也有  这就叫公正
Even him. It's called justice.

76
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,720
是啊  权利!
Yeah, right.

77
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,430
依我看  波塔尔死了
To see Baltar dead

78
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,850
星芭活着  那才叫公正呢
and Starbuck alive. That would be justice.

79
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,270
根本没有公正 看他喝的那样…
There's no justice. As drunk as he was...

80
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,640
赛道
SKULLS: Racetrack!

81
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,110
赛道你还好吧?  赛道
CALLY: Racetrack, are you okay? Racetrack!

82
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,320
救护员!
CALLY: Medic!

83
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,740
好了  好了  我接到他了  我接到他了 好
Yeah, yeah. I got him, I got him. Okay, okay.

84
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,080
你还好吗
You okay?

85
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,630
总统女士  总统女士

00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,140
你打算如何替换波塔尔的辩护律师呢?
How do you intend to replace Gaius Baltar's defense attorney?

87
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,970
也用抽签的方式吗?
Will that be done by lottery as well?

88
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,930
我们有把握尽快找到顶替人选
We're confident we'll replace him shortly.

89
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,190
有很多候选人  我们正按名单筛选  下一个
There's a number of candidates, we're working our way down the list. Next.

90
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,110
总统女士  总统女士
Madam President, Madam President. Karen.

91
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,480
考虑到这次爆炸显然这不是意外
Taken in the context of this explosion, which obviously was no accident,

92
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,070
您真的为认进行为这次审判
do you really think that it's in the best interest of the fleet

93
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,150
符合舰队的最佳利益吗?
to proceed with this trial?

94
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,160
政府绝不会接受恐怖主义
This administration will never bow to terrorism.

95
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,620
总统女士  总统女士
Madam President! Madam President!

96
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,160
等等  让我对大家说说这件事
ROSLIN: Wait. You know, let me say something here, to all of you.

97
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,080
让我说清楚了  好吗?
Let me get this clear, all right?

98
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,870
只要我还是总统
As long as I am President,

99
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,000
政府就不会允许任何恐怖主义
this administration will not allow terrorism

100
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,590
破坏我们的法律体制
to alter the framework of our legal system.

101
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,800
我们将进行严正审判
We will proceed with the trial.

102
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,510
谢谢大家
Rigorously. Thank you. All of you.

103
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,590
还有一个问题  请等等
One more question?

104
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:53,190
西洛  我要你带蓝队到7号区建立雷达哨所
Helo, I need you to set up a dradis picket with Blue Squadron in Sector 7.

105
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,450
呃  对不起  长官  你的意思是到9号地区吗?
Excuse me, sir. You mean Sector 9, right?

106
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,200
呃…
Uh...

107
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,670
对 对 9号 上次我们扫描过8号地区了
Right. Right, 9. Um, yeah, we scrubbed 8 on the last picket.

108
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,630
那里没什么动静  自然是到下一个区了
It's been so quiet, one pick just flows into the next.

109
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,590
好吧
Okay.

110
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,090
定位81  22度
81 carom, 22 degrees.

111
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,760
保持警惕 一旦发现赛昂人 立马撤退
Keep your ears open. Any Cylon contact, just shut down, bug out.

112
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,310
红队  
Red Squadron.

113
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,140
你们跟着我进行首次空中巡逻
You'll be riding first CAP with me.

114
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,560
并且  现在开始  两队轮班
And from here on, double shifts.

115
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,360
雅典娜  我要你专门负责往返飞行
Athena, I'm gonna need you exclusively on shuttle runs.

116
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,200
别忘了检查你们的后座底下
Well, don't forget to check under your back seat.

117
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,660
嘿  算你运气好  星芭
Hey, hey, you got lucky, Starbuck.

118
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,370
如果我是你  我会考虑去买...
If I were you, I would seriously consider buying a low...

119
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,130
是赛道 对不起
Racetrack, I'm sorry.

120
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,840
解散  解散
Dismissed. Dismissed.

121
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,990
知道你并不害怕  很是让人鼓舞
Well, it's so comforting to know that you're not afraid.

122
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,160
你并不害怕为这世上最被痛恨的家伙辩护
You're not afraid to represent the most hated man alive.

123
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,370
问题是  你是为了什么呢?
The question is why?

124
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,790
为了名气  荣誉
For the fame, the glory.

125
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,130
你曾在卡布里卡的公诉机关工作过
You worked in the Public Litigation Office on Caprica.

126
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,850
你觉得你能胜任这样级别的案子吗?
You think you have the qualifications to handle a case of this magnitude?

127
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,640
我天生就是干这个的
I was born for this.

128
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,730
事实上我有动力
That, and the fact that I have a pulse.

129
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,860
兰斯是我妻子的
Lance belonged to my wife.

130
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,780
别担心 "他"不会像"她"那样乱抓乱咬
Don't worry. He doesn't scratch or bite like she did.

131
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:07,750
如果能使你感到安慰的话 那我就小小地鄙视"他"一下
If it's of any comfort, I despise him as much as you do,

132
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,500
就像你不得不雇用我
having to hire me.

133
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,670
那么  到点子上了

审讯室会让我怯场

175
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,360
像这里也许就有
like this place probably is.

183
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,590
"小心驶得万年船"   这上面就是这么写的
Whoever cares the most, wins. Says so in there.

184
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,560

So?

185
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,520
我要见我的当事人  你不在乎的  我赢了
I want to see my client, you don't care, I win.

Security is already toasting my other attorney's untimely demise.

About the only thing that bloke ever did, apart from napping, was, you know,

你不明白 不是你跳进一架猛禽机就能飞 
You don't understand. You can't just jump in a Raptor.

有很多事情需要准备协调

好像出殡的未亡人?
As the parade float for the bereaved?

243
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,890
你在说些什么呢?

I need those files. You come with me, they might just give them to me.

249
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,360
如果我就这么等着 
I wait,

250
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,620
他们就会在我拿到手之前发现波塔尔的企图
they're gonna discover that Baltar's pregnant before I get them.

TYROL: Kitty, kitty. No, no, no, come on. Come here, kitty. Come here.

271
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,750
过来这里
Come here, come here.

272
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,300
炸弹!  有炸弹!  大家出去
Bomb! Bomb! Everybody out!

273
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,180
你到底在那里干什么?
What the hell were you doing out there?

274
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,940
我命令你执行任务
I gave you an order to do a job.

275
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,520
对不起  我是在执行任务
Excuse me. I was doing my job.

276
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,270
是啊  被人牵着鼻子到处跑?
Yeah, being led around by the nose?

277
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,030
那个混蛋拉一下项圈你就跟着跳?
This bastard yanks your chain and you jump?

278
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,860
他想要殖民地1号上的文件
He wanted files from Colonial One.

279
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,700
那是半夜
It was the middle of the night.

280
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,160
你让我当他的护卫的
Well, you assigned me to security.

281
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,370
是啊  那船上有颗炸弹
Yeah, and there was a bomb on that ship.

282
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,120
而你没有发现
And you missed it.

283
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,170
护卫?
"Security. "

284
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,550
我给你的命令够清楚了
I gave you explicit orders.

285
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,470
雅典娜在驾驶
Athena was piloting.

286
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,180
你可能会平白无故地死掉
You could have died, plain and simple.

287
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,060
你是一名战士
You're a soldier.

288
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,190
要活的像个战士 表现的像个战士
Live like one. Start acting like one.

289
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,620
她已经死了两周了 我没意识到时钟还在转
She's been gone two weeks. I didn't realize the clock was running.

290
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,070
不要说了   不  对不起  
Stop. No, I'm sorry,

291
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,580
也许我们生来就不同
'cause maybe we're just built differently.

292
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,990
别说了
You stop.

293
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,200
你怎知我有多痛苦!
Don't you dare quantify my loss.

294
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,710
你根本不了解
You have no idea.

295
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,750
你他妈的根本不了解
You have no frakking idea.

296
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,080
那你觉得你受伤更深?
What, you think yours is deeper?

297
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,090
你更悲痛欲绝?
Well... Yours is greater?

298
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,090
还有两周
In two weeks,

299
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,890
就要审判了!
there's going to be a trial,

300
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,510
我要做我该做的事 你也是
and I'm gonna do what I was chosen to do, and so are you.

301
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,940
你他妈给我盯紧了
You build a frakking nest around this man,

302
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,150
好生看着他!
and you protect his ass.

303
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,500
该死的这次玩真的了
Frakker meant business this time.

304
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,330
如果爆了  
If that thing had gone off, we'd be picking up

305
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,120
猛禽和人都会被炸得粉碎
Raptor and people parts with tweezers.

306
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,630
我每天都和那些机师打招呼
Every day, I wave jocks out there.

307
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,340
很多人都是我朋友 我喜爱的人
A lot of them are my friends, people I care for and love.

308
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,220
看他们在战斗中死去就够难受的了
It's hard enough watching them die in battle,

309
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,800
还要去给波塔尔的混蛋律师陪葬?    滚他妈的!
but rickshawing Baltar's frakking attorney around? Frak that.

310
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,310
我相信赛昂人是想要我们自相残杀
I believe that the Cylons want us to destroy ourselves,

311
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,350
并且他们正在这样做
and this is how they're doing it.

312
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,480
通过安置炸弹
By planting bombs,

313
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,900
让我们相互猜疑
making us suspicious of each other.

314
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,650
你们知道最可笑的是什么?  等赛昂人追上我们时  
You know what's funny, is by the time the Cylons catch up with us,

315
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,980
根本不用打
they won't even have to attack.

316
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,110
只要收拾烂摊子就行了
They'll just clean up the mess we made.

317
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,030
我觉得这里有赛昂人
I think they're here.

318
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,450
我觉得你错了
I think you're wrong.

319
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,450
好吧  我只知道今早我亲了尼奇
Okay, all I know is, I kissed Nicky this morning

320
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,830
这差点就成了吻别
and it could have been the last time.

321
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,870
够了  凯莉
Cally, that's enough.

322
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,830
什么?  我也亲了你!
What? I kissed you, too.

323
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,580
有些人可能没有第二次机会了
Some of us don't get a second chance.

324
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,920
或者第三次...
Or a third.

325
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,510
我去找上将
I'm going to the Admiral.

326
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,510
好了  仔细看看这个屋子
All right, take a good look at this room.

327
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,220
每次你离开  记住它
Every time you leave, memorize it.

328
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,180
如果有任何变化  别乱动
If anything changes, don't touch it.

329
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,230
一本书动了  鞋子放的地方不对
A book moves, shoes in the wrong place,

330
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,020
什么东西闻起来不对头 你就他妈的马上跑出去
something smells different, you get the frak out.

331
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,780
有人敲门  不给开  不要打开门!
Someone knocks, don't answer the door. Don't open the door.

332
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,280
你必须照我说的去做
Look, you have to do what I say.

333
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,070
如果他们想要杀我  他们总能找到办法
If they want to kill me, they'll find a way.

334
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,320
接下来  
Now,

335
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,200
我要贿赂谁才能见那个赛昂女人?
who do I have to bribe to see the Cylon woman?

336
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,000
成见是现代人的天性
The nature of one's life is obsession.

337
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,990
该死的  我找不到我的眼镜了  好像它们长了腿似的
Damn, I can't find my glasses. It's like they've got feet.

338
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,740
6号
The Six.

339
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,290
是的  没问题
Yes, okay.

340
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,920
拉姆金马上就能和6号会面  只要会面条件…
Lampkin can interview Six immediately, as long as it's conducted under

341
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,290
和上次检察长的一样就行  好吗?
the same conditions accorded to the Chief Prosecutor. All right?

342
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,130
就是说要在审讯室里
Meaning in the Interrogation Room,

343
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,670
不是你睡的地方
not where you sleep.

344
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,930
那当然  不过既然你被挑选为法官席的一员
Of course. But since you've been selected to serve on the tribunal,

345
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,087
为了公平起见
I'm assuming that you won't 

346
00:23:55,088 --> 00:23:57,600
我想你不会出现在这些会面中
be present at those interviews, in the interest of fairness.

347
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,470
少校说的有道理  比尔
Major has a point, Bill.

348
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,100
少校错了
Major's mistaken.

349
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,270
我监督了检察长的会面
I monitored the Chief Prosecutor's interview.

350
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,190
因此  在同样的条件下  
Therefore, same conditions apply.

351
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,940
为了公平起见
In the interest of fairness.

352
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,030
拉姆金先生仍然有权获得 
Mr. Lampkin is still entitled to

353
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,610
那些在殖民地1号上的文件
those documents that he requested from Colonial One.

354
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,950
是的  没错  我很抱歉
Yes, right. I apologize.

355
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,990
我们还没找到那些文件
We've had trouble locating the files.

356
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,790
下次送给你们好吗?
We'll have them delivered to you on the next run.

357
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,670
不好意思  少校  我们会很快给你   谢谢  
I'm sorry, Major. We'll get them to you right away. Thank you.

358
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,090
谢谢
Thank you.

359
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,000
我知道你与我的当事人有段浪漫的关系
LAMPKIN: I understand that you had a romantic relationship with my client.

360
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,420
盖尤斯・波塔尔是个很有才华的人类
Gaius Baltar is a brilliant, gifted human being.

361
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,250
我认识他的那段时间里 
In the time I've known him,

362
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,130
他撒谎成性  诡计多端
he's made a sport out of mendacity and deception.

363
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,050
自恋  自私  软弱  虚伪
He was narcissistic, self-centered, feckless and vain.

364
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,010
我本应该杀了他
I'm the one who should have stabbed him.

365
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,390
里面进展的不错
Things are looking up.

366
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,680
爱情...
Love.

367
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,520
超前的进化步伐使赛昂人…
A precocious evolutionary move, fashioning Cylons

368
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,020
能体验到它
to be capable of experiencing it.

369
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,980
我不知道是不是因为战术上的需要才被加入到你们的程序中
I don't know if it was engineered as a tactical imperative,

370
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,780
但这不为了那个胆小鬼  是吗?
but it's not for the faint-hearted, is it?

371
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,110
没错  不是
No, it's not.

372
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,280
也许你能对你们的"机械小兵"好一些
Maybe you should have been nicer to your mechanic.

373
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,330
也许赛昂人的爱情和人类的不一样
Well, perhaps Cylon love is not the same as human love.

374
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,540
也许它被设计的...伤得不那么深
Perhaps it's designed to hurt a little less.

375
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,210
你怎么知道?
How would you know?

376
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,880
我爱过一个女人
I loved a woman.

377
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,380
非常非常美丽的女人
Beautiful, beautiful woman.

378
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,010
但太严肃了
But so serious.

379
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,470
她那凝眉锁眸让多少社会名流为之倾倒
This frowning face trapped in the middle of a daisy.

380
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,020
她走路的样子...
She had a way of walking.

381
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,140
神圣得...
Processional.

382
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,310
好象圣女去就义一般
As if she were on her way to her own execution.

383
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,440
我们在一起生活了十年
We had 10 years.

384
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,030
最后被迫分手
Then it fell apart under its own weight.

385
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,740
这是你想要的结果吗?
Is that what you wanted?

386
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,490
我认为如果我能忘记她 我就能克服一切
I thought if I could get over her, I could get over anything.

387
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,120
我就能忍受  
I could endure,

388
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
超越 做个男人
conquer, be a man.

389
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,330
经得起任何的伤害
Stand up to any and all kind of punishment.

390
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,500
有好几个月  我独守空床  辗转反侧
I clung to an empty, spinning bed for months.

391
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,170
而那时候
And that?

392
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,970
我才终于意识到我是多么地爱她
That is when I finally realized how much I loved her.

393
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,930
我费尽力气才明白...
If I needed all that strength,

394
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,770
关键是什么
what was the point?

395
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
我要和她在一起
I needed to be with her.

396
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,860
他…
Did he...

397
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,610
有问起我吗?  盖尤斯?
Ask about me? Gaius?

398
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,210
他想知道你过的好不好
He wanted to know if you were well.

399
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,300
他想让你知道他有多么的想你
He wanted you to know that he misses you.

400
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,050
爱你
Loves you.

401
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,840
因为不能来亲自告诉你
Because he can't be here to tell you,

402
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,760
他让我把这个带给你
he gave me this, to give to you.

403
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,650
他冒死用这个
He uses that, at the risk of grave reprisal,

404
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,320
来表达他的感情
to express his feelings,

405
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,820
使他的世界变得有序可辨
to put his world into some kind of recognizable order.

406
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,900
使他的心声能被听见
To be heard.

407
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,290
他藏着它  因为他知道他再也得不到另一支了
He's kept it hidden because he knows he will not get another.

408
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,880
他希望你拥有它
He wants you to have it

409
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,920
因为没有你  一切都没有意义
because without you it has no meaning.

410
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,140
他希望你拥有它 因为他会不惜一切代价
He wants you to have it because he would do anything,

411
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,140
与你重聚
anything, to be with you again.

412
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,400
真是遗憾  不是吗?
Well, that's a shame, isn't it?

413
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,280
因为他们绝不会让我留着它
Since they'll never let me keep it.

414
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:36,380
你知道  你时日无多  又被人掌控
You understand that your days are owned and tallied by these people.

415
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,710
那些人正在外面看着我们
The ones out there, watching us.

416
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,010
我想你知道你最终的结局是什么
I think you realize what's likely to become of you.

417
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:46,800
即使他们付十倍于我替波塔尔辩护的钱  我也帮不了你
I couldn't help you if they paid me 10 times what they offered me for Baltar.

418
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,720
你不会被审判
You won't get a trial.

419
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,560
就算是不公平的审判也得不到 所以
Not even a bad one. So...

420
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,060
我不得不问你
I have to ask you.

421
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,150
爱情给你的伤害和我受到的一样深吗?
Does your love hurt as much as mine?

422
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,990
是的
Yes.

423
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,250
感觉好像天要塌了
I feel like part of our world just fell down.

424
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,020
嘿  伙计们
Hey, guys.

425
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,640
当然  长官
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

426
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,700
为什么鼓励他继续写作 然后又拿走他的笔?
Why encourage the man to write, and then take his pen?

427
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,620
如果外界知道他被禁言了 他会得到更多的同情
He'll curry more sympathy when we get the word out that he's been silenced.

428
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,910
暴政  压制言论自由  很有煽动性
Tyranny. Gag orders. Very sexy.

429
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,580
是啊  好吧
Okay, all right.

430
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,670
因此你就偷了他的笔  然后对他撒谎  接着又对6号撒谎
So you steal his pen, then you lie to him, then you lie to the Six.

431
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,550
时代的恐惧
The horror of the age.

432
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,050
巨大的丑闻 伪善的外衣
The great, ugly material. The cloak of deceit.

433
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,970
真相
The truth.

434
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
嗯
Hmm.

435
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,390
有点夸张了
Kind of overrated, I guess.

436
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,600
知道嘛  当我9岁的时候  也许10岁  
You know, when I was 9, maybe 10,

437
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,440
我爷爷...
my grandfather,

438
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,110
他招手让我过去
he would wave me over.

439
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,280
而且他每次都这样
And he'd do this all the time.

440
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,870
然后他说
And then he'd say,

441
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,750
"李  做个乖孩子"
"Lee, be a good boy.

442
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,880
"但不要太乖了"
"Just don't be too good. "

443
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,250
每人都有邪恶的一面
Everybody has demons.

444
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,010
他们  波塔尔  你  我
Them, Baltar, you, me.

445
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,430
甚至机器
Even the machines.

446
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,560
法律只是驱除邪恶的一种方式
The law is just a way of exorcising them.

447
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,810
你老爸的老爸就是这么告诉我的
That's what your father's father taught me.

448
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,060
你知道我为什么恨他么?
You want to know why I hated him?

449
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,520
因为他是对的
Because he was right.

450
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,900
你憎恶他  是因为他是正确的
So, you hated him because he was right,

451
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,610
而我憎恶法律  是因为它是错误的
and I hated the law, because it was wrong.

452
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,360
因为法律使得他...
Because of what...

453
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,990
我是说  法律使得他
Of what it put him through.

454
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,910
保护了最坏的人
I mean, he defended the worst of the worst.

455
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,410
我记得我读过他的阅历
I remember reading about him.

456
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,120
暴力
The outrage.

457
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,580
帮暴力杀人犯开脱罪行 我不理解的是
Helping murderers go free. What I don't understand is

458
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,710
他为什么要把自己搅和到那些污七八糟的事情里去
why he put himself through all that abuse.

459
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,050
你认为他做的事情都毫无意义?
You think he gave a flying frak?

460
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,970
约・阿达玛很在乎一件事
Joe Adama cared about one thing,

461
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,890
去了解人们为什么要这么做
understanding why people do what they do.

462
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,890
为什么我们要欺骗朋友
Why we cheat our friends,

463
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,440
为什么我们要勾结敌人 为什么我们要打仗
why we reward our enemies, why we go to war.

464
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,280
为毫无胜算的事情浪费光阴
Sacrificing our lives for lost causes.

465
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,570
为什么我们希望制造机器
Why we build machines in the hope

466
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:55,490
来纠正我们的瑕疵与缺陷  我们为什么会宽恕 
of correcting our flaws and our shortcomings, why we forgive.

467
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,120
会违背逻辑规律和自然法则
Defying logic and the laws of nature

468
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:04,380
仅仅因为那小小的愚蠢的同情心
with one stupid, little act of compassion.

469
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,000
我们有缺陷  我们所有人
We're flawed. All of us.

470
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,340
我想知道为什么
I wanted to know why.

471
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,050
所以我做了…
So, I did

472
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,800
他做过的事
what he did.

473
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,850
我一生都与堕落…
I spend my life with the fallen.

474
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,680
和败坏为伍
The corrupt, the damaged.

475
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,190
再看看你
Look at you.

476
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,190
你那么迫不及待和我一起跳入猛禽机
You were so ready to get on that Raptor with me.

477
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,440
做个坏孩子  屡教不改的小坏蛋
Be the bad boy, the prodigal son.

478
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,940
不  我只是在执行任务  保护你
No. I was just doing my job protecting you.

479
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,530
那你为什么要插手我的事?
What are you doing in my business?

480
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,660
"突然我被一堆矛盾思想禁锢了"
Suddenly I'm handcuffed to a serial contrarian.

481
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,250
不  我没有
No, I am not...

482
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,210
哦  是的
Okay, okay.

483
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,830
我的问题很明了啦
My bed is made.

484
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,090
我建议你好好想想你自己的
I suggest you toil on your own.

485
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,340
那么  如果盘问结束了的话
Now, if this cross-examination is over,

486
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,340
我想休息了
I'd like to take a crap.

487
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,310
罗默  你讲的那个女孩的故事  那个你爱过
Romo, that story you told about the girl, the woman that you loved,

488
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,070
又尝试忘记的女人… 是真的吗?
getting over her, is it true?

489
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,400
嘿  那是真的吗?
Hey, was it true?

490
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,950
是
Yes.

491
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,170
给他的  来自殖民地1号的文件
For him. Files from Colonial One.

492
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,260
终于… 我还以为要等审判结束了才能拿到呢
Finally. I thought I'd get all these after the trial was over.

493
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,390
等等  
Hold it.

494
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,640
先放地板上
Put that on the floor, now.

495
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,220
哦  妈的
For frak's sake.

496
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,690
我看到凯利用X光照过了 都是些文件
I was there when Kelly X-rayed them. It's papers.

497
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,230
给你
There you go.

498
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,360
没问题吧?
Good?

499
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,530
是的
Yeah.

500
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,790
不!
No!

501
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,140
你有五分钟  少校
You've got five minutes, Major.

502
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,270
谢谢
Thank you.

503
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,190
在猎犬嗅到之前 打开
Before the hounds got to it. Open it.

504
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,450
总统的眼镜
The President's glasses.

505
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,330
她不戴这个更好看些
She looks better without them.

506
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,130
没那么严肃了
Less serious.

507
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,340
法庭上气氛太严肃了
Serious catches on in the courtroom.

508
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,510
你父亲的
Your father's.

509
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,930
什么时候?
When?

510
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,480
在甲板上
From the deck.

511
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,150
就是你们在猛禽机底下发现炸弹以后
Right after you found the bomb underneath the Raptor.

512
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,440
嘿...猫咪...猫咪
Here, kitty, kitty.

513
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,110
用根线穿着
It was hanging by a thread.

514
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,700
它锈地好快
They tarnish so fast.

515
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,740
在我摘掉它时就是如此
Was like that when I plucked it.

516
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,330
其他每个人的  泰的  
Everybody else, Tigh, the others,

517
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,950
你的 都闪闪发光
you, all shiny.

518
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,540
他身上战士的气息太重了
The soldier in him has had enough for a while.

519
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,630
他会很乐意坐在那个法庭上展示他的火力
He'll be glad to sit in that courtroom and fire his missiles there.

520
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,220
走廊尽头
Ms. Prosecuting Attorney.

521
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,810
那个控方律师小姐的
Down the hall.

522
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,430
别想歪了
It's not what you think.

523
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,690
我的想法还是比较纯洁的
It was appropriated with the noblest of intentions.

524
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,860
看看鞋底
See the soles?

525
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,190
看看这鞋底磨的
See how the soles are worn?

526
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,820
她走路拖步子
She drags her feet.

527
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,910
你理解上去了
You're catching on.

528
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,910
其他的呢?  这些都是什么?
And the rest? What's all this?

529
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,750
我邪恶的一面
My demons.

530
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,840
我"借"了些东西
I borrow things.

531
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,920
我的父母在我9岁时失踪了
My parents disappeared when I was 9 years old.

532
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,300
他们被绑架了
They were kidnapped.

533
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,430
被撕票了
Murdered for...

534
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,100
因为身上的钱不够
For the money they had on them, which wasn't enough.

535
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,390
我去和一个叔叔生活
I went to live with an uncle.

536
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,860
逃走之前从他那里偷了这些
Stole from him until I could run away.

537
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,230
那么你从我这拿了什么?
So, what did you take from me?

538
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,240
我在想你带在身上的照片
I was thinking the photograph that you carry.

539
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,120
那个飞行员女孩
That girl. The pilot.

540
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,030
你带在身边的那张
The one you carry on you.

541
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,370
但你被偷走的已经够多的了
But you've had enough stolen from you already.

542
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,130
不知何故...我想我会设法把这个还给她的
I'll try and get these back to her somehow.

543
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,760
后面还有一个口袋
The other pocket, at the back.

544
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,890
守卫从她那里拿走
The guards took it from her.

545
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,310
我又从他们那儿"借"走了
I borrowed it from them.

546
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,860
我们仍有个快要审理的案子
I still have a case pending.

547
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,330
如果你想要帮忙
If you want to help,

548
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,830
如果你敢帮这个忙
if you dare to help,

549
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,630
把这个还给我的当事人

550
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,710
案子?
A case?

551
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,460
我有职业操守
I have a calling,

552
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,510
在我耳边不断地提醒我
so the ringing in my ears tells me.

553
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,850
好吧  你最好解释一下这个
Okay, you better explain this.

554
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,270
我甚至不知道这是什么
Don't even know what it is.

555
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,770
我知道  你从哪儿拿来的?
Well, I do. Where did you get it?

556
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,020
那个把你当小学生一样教训的人
The one that scolded you like a schoolboy,

557
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,610
妈的  用用你的脑子  他的名字? 严肃先生
frakking with your head. What's his name? Mr. Serious.

558
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,490
凯利
Kelly.

559
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,790
凯...凯利?
Kelly?

560
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,990
是的
Yeah.

561
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,220
你在那架猛禽机上 我是绝对不会上雅典娜升空的
I never would have let Athena go airborne with you in the Raptor.

562
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,430
你知道  我会阻止的
I would have stopped it. You know that.

563
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,810
是  我知道
Yeah, I know that.

564
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,020
你最好把我关起来
You better lock me up.

565
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,980
我不想要什么审判 我不会停止的
And I don't want any trial. I won't stop.

566
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,230
我会继续尝试

567
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,740
我会坚持不懈  我会的
I'll keep at it, I will.

568
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,070
我做了自己的工作  长官
I did my job, sir,

569
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,120
我已经干了两年

570
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,410
每天我送人们去战场
Every day, I sent people out to fight,

571
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,290
然后帮他们收尸
I cleared them all to die.

572
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,750
那么多人
So many people.

573
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,590
我不想再这样子下去了
I just got tired of living with that.

574
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,840
你问问那个人  如果要选 
You ask that man, if he had to choose

575
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,850
是为人类死  还是为赛昂死?
between giving his life up for a Cylon or a human,

576
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,020
你猜他会怎么说
what do you think he'd say?

577
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,100
我必须做点什么
I had to do something.

578

很抱歉 我错了

584
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,750
我把事情搞得更糟糕了   不  
I made it worse. No.

585
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,340
不 你知道你应该在你的战机里

586
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,800
我想我该和拉姆金在一起

587
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,760
既然我们知道了是凯利干的

588
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,510
我们就可以稍微放松一下安全措施了
we can ease up a little bit on security.

589
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,560
就拉姆金的身体状况来看 我想他需要人帮他准备审判 
In his condition, I think Lampkin needs help preparing the trial,

590
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,730
陈述案情
presenting his case.

591
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:03,520
总统还有些其他候选人 她在考虑
The President has a few possibilities. She's looking.

592
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,310
爸  为什么不是我?

597
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,620
我想做这个

598
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,160
你是空军飞行队长
You're a CAG.

599
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,620
你不是律师 差的远了
You're not a lawyer. Far from it.

600
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,750
难道你就是法官了?
What? And you're a judge?

601
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,710
不是  但就像其他四个被挑选出来的人

602

我有能力采纳证据

作出合理的判断

00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,520
我要你当好空军飞行队长
I need you as CAG.

607
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,850
那你为什么给我这些书?
Why did you give me those books? Huh?

608
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,190
我是说  你给了我你父亲的法律书
I mean, you gave me your father's law books.

609
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,560

你怕我变成他那样?
Are you afraid that I'll be like him?

612
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,110
你是飞行员
You're a pilot.

613
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,660
因为扎克和卡拉都死了

615
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,700
你是飞行员并且你是我儿子
You're a pilot and you're my son.

616
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,660
我不想看到你坐在法庭的另一边
I will not look across that court and see you sitting on the other side.

617
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,630
看到我?  还是看到其他人?
See me? Or see someone else?

618

回去报到吧

你跑题太远了

我不会再对你下命令了
I'm through giving you orders.

624
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,910
把阿波罗开除出甲板 通知西洛他还是空军飞行队长
Remove Apollo from the board. Inform Helo he's to remain at CAG.

625
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,580
我儿子还有更重要的事要照料

嘿  腿怎么样了?

627

给了我个不来这儿的理由

630
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,620
你会用完借口的
you run out of excuses.

631
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,040
很难就这样让她走了...

没有更伟大的同盟 没有更强大的力量 
LAMPKIN: "There's no greater ally, no force more powerful,

635

没有更顽固的敌人
"no enemy more resolved,

636
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:52,290
比得上一个愿意走出父亲阴影的儿子

637
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,040
