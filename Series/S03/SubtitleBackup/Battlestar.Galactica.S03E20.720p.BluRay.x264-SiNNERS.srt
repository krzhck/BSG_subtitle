00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,290
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》前情回顾
APOLLO: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,710
就是它了 是它 爱奥尼亚星云
This is it. That's it. The lonian Nebula.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,340
你说我们会有何发现?  信标?  神庙?
So what do you think we'll find? A beacon? Temple?

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,180
通往地球的路标?
Signpost to Earth?

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,930
还有多少次跳跃才能找到那座星云?
How many more jumps before we find the nebula?

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,060
我估计要十二次
I'm estimating an even dozen.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,020
快了 仍旧没有赛昂人的影子
We're getting close. Still no sign of the Cylons.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,190
我没听到你们说的什么…
SKULLS: I didn't hear you nuggets say that...

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,690
往回调  就差一点
SAM: There. Go back. You almost had it.

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,030
什么差一点?
SEELIX: Had what?

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,490
那首曲子  你没听到?
That song. You don't hear that song?

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,490
在他娘的船里!
It's in the frakking ship!

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,200
这是我的儿子
This is my son.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,370
节哀顺变 但这不是我的责任
I am very sorry for your loss, but I am not responsible.

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,620
我知道  他病了 我求你保佑他
I know. He's sick, and I want you to bless him.

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,080
保佑他?
Bless him?

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,550
您是说被告盖尤斯・波塔尔...
You are saying that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, ordered your execution

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,970
下令处决您和其他200名民众?
and the execution of 200 other people?

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,970
正是如此
That is exactly what I am saying.

20
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,640
这是一份死刑执行令 你看过这份名单上的名字吗?
This is a death warrant. Have you seen the names on this list?

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,520
你知道他们会怎么做吗?
Do you have any idea what they're about to do out there?

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,230
盖尤斯・波塔尔选择与赛昂人为伍
Gaius Baltar chose to side with the Cylons

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,570
并主动迫害他的子民
and to actively seek the deaths of his fellow citizens.

24
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,490
总统阁下 您此时是否服用了卡马拉?
Madam President, are you taking chamalla at this time?

25
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,240
不用回答他 这场审判到此为止
Don't answer. I'm putting a stop to this right now.

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,030
法官大人 如果她服用了此药  
Your Honors, if she is on drugs,

27
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:20,740
她作为证人的可信度理应受到质疑
 it goes to her credibility as a witness.

28
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,950
我再次服用卡马拉是因为我的癌症复发了
I am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned.

29
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,830
你是一个骗子和孬种
ADAMA: I'm calling you a liar and a coward.

30
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,460
为了什么?
And for what?

31
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,050
就为了那个背信弃义的垃圾 盖尤斯・波塔尔么?
That traitorous piece of garbage Gaius Baltar.

32
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,590
他就不配得到审判
He doesn't even deserve a trial.

33
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,850
我不会为一个质疑我忠诚的人效力
I will not serve under a man who questions my integrity.

34
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,980
我也不会让一名欠缺此种品质的人
And I won't have an officer under my command

35
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,060
做我部下
who doesn't have any.

36
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,310
妈的
Frak me.

37
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,020
喂?
Yes.

38
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,440
骂我一顿 我不想下床
Yell at me. I don't want to get out of bed.

39
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,620
你打错电话了 我正要去睡觉
Well, you called the wrong number. I was just thinking about going back to bed.

40
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,910
你感觉还好吧?
You feeling okay?

41
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,950
身患绝症的人还好意思问我
Says the cancer patient.

42
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,960
恩  还好  刚划了自己一刀
Yeah, I'm fine. I just cut myself.

43
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,670
你怎么样?
How are you doing?

44
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,290
我不想去面对他们
I don't want to face them.

45
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,420
不想去面对他们任何人 只想整天躺在床上睡觉
I don't want to face any of them. I just want to stay in bed all day and sleep.

46
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,090
我已经把血止住了
I think I've stopped the bleeding.

47
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,970
如果还想找人教训你 我可以代劳
If you still need to be yelled at, I think I can give you some volume.

48
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,770
好 好 尽全力来吧
Okay. All right. Give it your best shot.

49
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,940
从床上下来!
Get out of that bed!

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
你没尽全力
That's not your best shot.

51
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,110
罗丝琳 把你的大屁股从床上挪下来
Get your fat, lazy ass out of that rack, Roslin!

52
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,700
是  长官    遵命  长官
Yes, sir. Okay, sir. Anything you say, sir.

53
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,280
谢谢
Thank you.

54
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,250
别让他们看到你焦虑不安的样子 劳拉
Don't let them see you sweat, Laura.

55
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,920
过来
Come here.

56
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,340
不行
I can't.

57
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,770
来吧
Come here.

58
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,270
我得回殖民者一号
I've got to go back to Colonial One.

59
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,560
你哪都不能去
You don't have to go anywhere.

60
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,940
这是什么音乐?  天啊
What is that music? Gods.

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,990
你刚才说什么?
What did you just say?

62
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,490
惨了
Frak.

63
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,160
好  来了
Yeah. I'm coming.

64
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,330
为什么锁门?          
Hey. Why is the door locked?

65
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,750
不好意思
Sorry.

66
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,730
我们应该采取失审这一招 译注:即再次重新审理
We should go for a mistrial.

67
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,820
什么?  他是什么意思?
What? What's he talking about?

68
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,030
你什么意思啊?  失审?  为什么?
What are you talking about? A mistrial? Whatever for?

69
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,240
因为我们处于劣势
Because we're losing.

70
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,740
我可没看出来
Not from where I'm standing.

71
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,120
我们其实做得很好啊
We're actually doing quite well.

72
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,950
我们就快要把控方压倒了
We're just about to break the prosecution.

73
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,200
我们已把他们的两名关键证人拉下了马
We've blown two of their key witnesses out of the water.

74
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,080
我们还要怎么做啊?
What more do we need to do, for Gods' sakes?

75
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,130
在场的每个人都对你恨之入骨 每个人 包括法官们
Everyone in that courtroom hates you. Everyone. Including the judges.

76
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,170
你还没听到我父亲叫你什么
You didn't hear what my father just called you.

77
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,880
他说你是一个背信弃义的垃圾
He called you "a traitorous piece of garbage. "

78
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,220
说你不配得到审判
A man who doesn't even deserve a trial.

79
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,680
他是那么说的么?  真那么说了?
He said that? He actually said that?

80
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,010
对  不错
Yes, he did.

81
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,600
我看不只他一个人这么想
And I don't think he's the only one up there.

82
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,640
我同意 我们的战术胜利让他们大动肝火
I agree. Our tactical victories are pissing them off.

83
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,770
那我们现在得势反倒变成失势了?
Right. So, now, because we're winning, we're losing, actually.

84
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,150
有违常理  对吧?  这也是我热爱这份工作的原因之一
Perverse, isn't it? One of the reasons why I love what I do.

85
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,070
"强行使用失审表面看来 也许对双方都有利
"Forcing a mistrial may seem of little benefit to either side,

86
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,030
但实际上 对辩方来讲不失为一份恩惠
"but in fact, it can be a boon to the defense.

87
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,160
控方已经摊牌 当复审时 
"The prosecution's shown their hand. At retrial, the defense has

88
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,750
辩方拥有一切战术优势
"all the tactical advantages

89
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,380
且被判为无罪的机会 将上升25个百分点"
"and the statistical chances of an acquittal rise by 25%."

90
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,790
乔瑟夫・亚当玛著
"Joseph Adama. "

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,710
第237页上的"审判战术与策略"
"Trial Tactics and Strategies," page 273.

92
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,630
你的祖父是一位聪明人
Smart man, your grandfather.

93
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,840
我明白你为什么要走失审这步棋了
Yeah, well, I can see why you want a mistrial.

94
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,300
不好意思  你这是什么意思?
I'm sorry. What is that supposed to mean?

95
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,850
这是你推卸责任…
Well, that would be the quickest way, wouldn't it?

96
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,680
最快的办法
For you to absolve all of your responsibility.

97
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,980
放下这个烂摊子一走了之 返回到你自己的生活
Wash your hands of the whole affair. You get back to your life.

98
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,350
你返回到属于你的地方
You get back to wherever you get back to.

99
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,980
而我却要回到牢里 再经历一次这种事
And I get back to a cell, and I have to go through this all over again.

100
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,280
我身体上无法承受这一切了
I can't physically take that!

101
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,490
不要策略 不要失审
No more games. No mistrials.

102
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,280
只求一个判决结果
There will be a verdict.

103
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,113
昨日对盖尤斯・波塔尔博士的审判 
Yesterday marked a surprising 

104
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:31,170
当泰上校承认杀死了自己妻子时
turn of events in the trial of Dr. Gaius Baltar,

105
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,920
上演了令人惊讶的逆转
when Colonel Tigh admitted to killing his wife.

106
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,220
在你们这群菜鸟想驾机上天之前
Before any of you nuggets can even think about flying one of my Raptors,

107
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,430
你们必须熟悉了解飞行系统 电子元件  航空控制系统
you have to know Systems, Electronics, Avionics,

108
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,730
导航系统  引擎控制系统
Navigation, Engine Controls,

109
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,440
雷达配置 超光速引擎
Dradis Configuration, Basic FTL Functions,

110
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,820
自动驾驶装置 动力装置
Autopilot Gearing, and Propulsion Systems.

111
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,960
掌握这些知识最快的办法是要登上猛禽  
The best way to learn that is on a Raptor,

112
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:57,950
就是说要实践操作
 and that means getting your hands dirty.

113
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,870
来吧
Move. Come on.

114
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,950
过来 快 上来
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

115
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,630
嗨 山姆
Hey, Sam.

116
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,640
你哼的是什么曲子?
That song you're humming. What is that?

117
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,470
哦…
Oh. Uh...

118
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,180
连我自己都不知道
You know what? I don't even know.

119
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,900
这首曲子一直在我脑中回荡
It's just something I can't get out of my head.

120
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,520
挥之不去
Some way out of here.

121
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,110
我也一直听到这种声音
I've been hearing that.

122
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,860
无处不在 在收音机中 在酒吧里
Everywhere. On a boombox, you know? In the bar.

123
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,750
到这边来
Come here.

124
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,340
你也听到那首曲子了?
You hear that song?

125
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,710
是啊  把我吓坏了
Yeah. And it's freaking me out.

126
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,590
我走到哪里都能听到 可又听不清  
I hear it everywhere. I mean... But I can't really hear it.

127
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,430
你懂我的意思么?
Do you know what I mean?

128
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,560
懂 就像是你刚抓住一段旋律 
Yeah. It's like you can grab just a part of the melody,

129
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,720
而它又马上消失了 像是一段…
and then it goes away, like it's something from...

130
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,890
童年的记忆
BOTH: Childhood.

131
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,810
正是
Exactly.

132
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,320
安德斯!  你还用我他妈叫你吗?
Yo, Anders! Do you need a frakking invitation?

133
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,190
快来!
Move it!

134
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,410
来啦 用不着那么激动吧
All right. No reason to get excited.

135
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,460
恭喜你 你从你的第一次 "呔唠醺"疗法中挺了过来
Well, congratulations. You survived your first Doloxan treatment.

136
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,260
真是以毒攻毒啊
Talk about the cure being worse than the disease.

137
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,220
下次带本书或一些书面文件
Well, next time, bring a book or some paperwork.

138
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,680
这样有助于帮你分散注意力
It would help keep your mind off of it,

139
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
还能帮助降压
and it would also help keep your blood pressure down.

140
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,020
可得了吧
Yeah, right.

141
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,140
失陪了  
Now, if you'll excuse me,

142
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,600
我还有其他病人
I do have some other patients.

143
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,190
好  去吧
All right. Go.

144
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,900
真要命
Oh, Gods.

145
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,030
赫拉!
Hera!

146
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,130
怎么回事?
COTTLE: What's going on?

147
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,100
你们俩怎么同时惊叫了起来?
You're both freaking out at the same time?

148
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,610
我们要单独呆一会 请把这东西拿下来
We need a moment. Take this off. Get this off me, please.

149
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,480
谁能告诉我到底怎么回事?
Will somebody please tell me what the hell is going on?

150
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,050
出去吧 谢谢 我们不会有事 把门关上
You can go outside. Thank you. We'll be fine. Shut the door.

151
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,840
是  阁下
GUARD: Yes, ma'am.

152
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,140
不好意思  给你带上了手铐
I'm sorry about the shackles.

153
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,140
刚才你是否和我们...
Were you with us a moment ago?

154
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,230
在一座歌剧院的大厅里?
In the lobby of the opera house?

155
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,320
看你脸上的表情  我想是了
I'll take that as a yes, by the look on your face.

156
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,450
我当时也在场 赫拉也在
I was there, too. And so was Hera.

157
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,120
那是不可能的
That shouldn't be possible.

158
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,710
不可能的事多着呢
Add it to the list.

159
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,250
你当时是想得到赫拉么?
Were you trying to reach Hera?

160
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,300
不知道
I don't know.

161
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,590
我只知道自己 要竭尽全力保护她
I just knew that I had to protect her with my life.

162
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,400
我告诉你  比尔  他们在这船上放音乐  我能听到
I'm telling you, Bill, they've put the music in the ship. I can hear it.

163
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,110
我相信你 我会调查一下
I believe you. I'll look into it.

164
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,490
你会调查?
You'll look into it?

165
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,685
你会调查? 
You'll look into it? 

166
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:08,030
我可是在说赛昂人在我们的船上搞破坏
I am here telling you there is Cylon sabotage aboard our ship!

167
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,410
用音乐搞破坏?
Sabotage? With music?

168
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,650
我自己也不是很明白 
I know, I know.

169
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:15,460
不过有许多事情令人迷惑不解
 I can't quite understand it myself, but there's too much confusion.

170
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,590
我保证会去调查的
I promise I'll look into it.

171
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,880
现在我要去法庭了
Now, I have to get to court.

172
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,590
好
Okay.

173
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,050
好
Okay.

174
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,010
去法庭吧
You go to court.

175
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,950
一定有出去的办法
There must be some kind of way out of here.

176
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,830
你认识这份文件吗  中尉?
Do you recognize this document, Lieutenant?

177
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,910
是的  认识
Yes, I do.

178
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,790
这是一份由新卡布里卡上总统办公室签发的死刑名单
It's a death list issued on New Caprica by the office of the President.

179
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,260
是谁签署的这份文件?
Who signed this document?

180
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,220
盖尤斯・波塔尔总统
President Gaius Baltar.

181
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,430
它有可能是伪造的吗?
Could it be a forgery?

182
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,100
不可能
No.

183
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,270
你怎么知道不是伪造的?
And how do you know that it cannot be a forgery?

184
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,860
因为当时我在场亲眼看他签的字
Because I was there. I saw him sign it.

185
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,190
什么?
BALTAR: What?

186
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,280
你在胡说什么?  你不在场!  真是谎话连篇 
What are you talking about? You weren't there! That's a lie!

187
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,360
完全是在捏造事实
That's a total fabrication!

188
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,530
肃静!
FRANKS: Order!

189
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,910
我看到他签了字
I saw him sign it.

190
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,950
描述一下当时的情况  好吗?
Describe the scene, would you?

191
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,710
赛昂人把这份文件 带到了总统办公室
The Cylons brought the document to the Presidential office.

192
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,960
他们已经选定了名字
They'd already selected the names.

193
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,010
他们当中一人 我相信是一名三号
One of them, I believe it was a Three,

194
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,970
她把那份名单递给总统  然后说道:
gave the list to the President and said,

195
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,180
"这些是即将被处决的人  请签字"
"Here are the people that are going to be executed. Please, sign this. "

196
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,140
他看着名单  看到名单上的名字
He looked at the list, he saw all the names,

197
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,360
然后签了字
and then he signed it.

198
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,900
他反对过吗?  他是否争执过?
Did he protest? I mean, did he argue?

199
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,940
是否做出了任何反抗举动?
Did he offer any resistance whatsoever?

200
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,910
签字
Sign it!

201
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,490
我不会签的
I won't do it.

202
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,580
去找别的方法减轻你的负罪感吧
You're going to have to salve your consciences some other way.

203
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,870
签字!  签上你的名字!  签上!
Sign it! Sign your name! Sign it!

204
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,590
没有 他从没那么做过
No. He never did.

205
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,050
菲里克斯
Oh, Felix.

206
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,670
菲里克斯  你这是干什么?
Oh, Felix. What are you doing?

207
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,180
拿到一边去
Get that out of my face...

208
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,640
盖尤斯 我们在诘问的时候再揭穿他
Gaius, it's okay, we'll get him on cross.

209
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,010
律师  让你的委托人克制一下好吗?
Counsel, will you control your client?

210
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,220
这不是什么新鲜事          
Look, it's no secret!

211
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,560
安静  整个舰队都知道这个人 
Quiet. The whole fleet knows this man tried

212
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,440
想除我而后快  你没得手!  蠢货!
to stab me through the neck! And you missed! Butterfingers!

213
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,650
抱歉  法官大人  闭嘴
Sorry, Your Honors. Shut up.

214
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,520
没有问题了
No further questions.

215
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,540
该你讯问证人了  律师
Your witness, Counselor.

216
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,050
我没有问题
No questions.

217
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,260
什么?!
What?

218
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,760
你怎么…
What, are you...

219
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,810
证人退庭
The witness is dismissed.

220
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,390
这可好
BALTAR: Oh, great.

221
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,060
你这是干什么?
BALTAR: What the hell are you doing?

222
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,810
你们俩现在是各执一词
Listen, it's your word against his right now.

223
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,480
如果他已决定做伪证  我们也无能为力
If he's decided to perjure himself, there's nothing we can do to change that now.

224
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,690
我们要调整一下策略
We'll have to adjust our strategy.

225
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,590
辩方做好辩护准备了吗?
Is the defense prepared to present their case?

226
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,930
法官大人...
Your Honors.

227
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,690
现在  如果庭上允许
At this time, if it please the court,

228
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,730
我想提出一个动议
I would like to offer a motion.

229
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,780
辩方想要提议失审
The defense would like to move for a mistrial.

230
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,160
不  我们不想要失审  我不要失审
No! We do not want a mistrial! I do not want a mistrial!

231
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,700
盖尤斯・波塔尔!
Gaius Baltar!

232
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,700
注意举止  波塔尔博士
Behave, Dr. Baltar.

233
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,910
以什么为依据  律师?
On what grounds, Counselor?

234
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,710
庭上一位法官
On the grounds that one of the panel

235
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,800
已对审判结果做出预断 (译注:即提前决定)
has already prejudged the outcome of this trial and determined the guilt

236
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,220
并裁定被告有罪
of the defendant.

237
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,340
这可是一项非常严重的指控 拉姆金先生
ADAMA: That's a very serious charge, Mr. Lampkin.

238
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,470
哪位法官?
Which judge?

239
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,810
那就是你  上将
That would be you, Admiral.

240
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,020
为了证明此事 我要采取非常措施 
And to prove it, I need to take the unusual step

241
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,940
传李・亚当玛先生出庭作证
of calling Mr. Lee Adama to the stand.

242
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,110
你他妈在开玩笑吧
You've got to be frakking kidding me.

243
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
盖塔已把我们推下水 
Gaeta sunk us.

244
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,910
我们惟有以此才能取胜
This is the only way we're going to win.

245
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,580
我不会做出对我父亲不利的证言
I will not testify against my father.

246
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,420
那由你来决定 无论如何 我都要让你出庭作证
That is your choice. Either way, I'm putting you on the stand.

247
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,420
法官大人 这样做根本不合适
Your Honors. This is completely improper.

248
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,300
法律顾问在任何情况下 都不能出庭作证
Counsel cannot testify at trial under any circumstances.

249
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,090
我随口可以举出至少七个这样的先例
I can cite at least seven precedents off the top of my head.

250
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,270
传唤你的证人  律师
Call your witness, Counselor.

251
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,730
谢谢
Thank you.

252
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,860
亚当玛先生
Mr. Adama.

253
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:54,800
亚当玛先生 你是否与你的父亲亚当玛上将在四天前见过面?
Mr. Adama, did you meet with your father, Admiral Adama, four days ago?

254
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,260
是的
Yes.

255
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,310
在那次见面的时候 亚当玛上将是否就被告应否 
At that meeting, did Admiral Adama express an opinion

256
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,190
得到审判这一点发表过个人看法?
as to whether the defendant deserved a trial?

257
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:20,530
我只想知道事实真相  亚当玛先生  请讲
All I'm looking for is the truth, here, Mr. Adama. Let's have it.

258
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,570
我在等着 回答问题
I'm waiting. Answer the question.

259
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,750
你以军官的身份 曾在这法庭上发过誓
You swore an oath as an officer of the court.

260
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,580
如果你不回答问题 你就会使整套司法体制…
If you don't answer the question, you hold the entire system of justice...

261
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,000
什么他妈的体制?
What frakking system?

262
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,170
亚当玛先生!
Mr. Adama!

263
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,890
抱歉  法官大人
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

264
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,140
请原谅我的同事
Please excuse my associate.

265
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,440
好吧  好吧  我换个问题
All right, all right. I'll try something else.

266
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,940
你认为被告应得到公正的审判吗?
Do you believe that the defendant deserves a fair trial?

267
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,120
事实上  我认为是的      为什么?
As a matter of fact, I do. Why?

268
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,170
抛开每人都理应得到 公正的审判这一事实不说
Well, aside from the fact that everyone deserves a fair trial,

269
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,380
我恰恰相信他没有罪  
I also happen to believe that he is not guilty of the charges

270
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,500
应当被无罪释放
and should be acquitted.

271
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,130
法官大人  我必须坚持反对
Your Honors, I must insist on an exception here!

272
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,880
他不能采用这种方式作证 这根本不合适
He cannot testify in this manner. It's completely improper.

273
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,720
我同意 他可以在结案陈词中
I agree. He can make his arguments

274
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,050
阐述此观点 不能在作证时说
in closing statements, not on the stand.

275
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,100
我同意控方所说的这一点
I'm inclined to agree with the prosecution.

276
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,980
谢谢
CASSIDY: Thank you.

277
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,350
如果你认为此做法影响了判决结果 你可以向总统上诉
You can appeal to the President if you feel that this influences the verdict.

278
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,980
但就我个人来讲...
But I, for one,

279
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,990
想听一下这位证人作证
would like to hear this witness testify.

280
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,320
我赞成
MALE JUDGE: I would second that.

281
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,200
继续
Continue.

282
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,200
谢谢  法官大人
Thank you, Your Honors.

283
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,040
亚当玛先生
Mr. Adama?

284
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,160
亚当玛先生
Mr. Adama!

285
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,370
在
Yes?

286
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:03,170
你为何认为被告盖尤斯・波塔尔是无罪的?
Why do you believe that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, deserves to be acquitted?

287
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:10,100
因为没有证据能证明他所受到的指控
Well, because the evidence does not support the charges.

288
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,930
不是吧
Come on.

289
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,140
被告有过错吗?
Did the defendant make mistakes?

290
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,020
当然有
Sure. He did.

291
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,940
严重的错误 但他真的犯了什么罪吗?
Serious mistakes. But did he actually commit any crimes?

292
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,030
他犯了叛国罪吗?  没有
Did he commit treason? No.

293
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,740
当时的情况非人力可抗拒
I mean, it was an impossible situation.

294
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,870
当赛昂人到来之时  他又能怎么办?
When the Cylons arrived, what could he possibly do?

295
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,080
谁又能做些什么?
What could anyone have done?

296
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,410
各位扪心自问  你们会怎么做?
I mean, ask yourself. What would you have done?

297
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,710
你们又能做些什么?
What would you have done?

298
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,710
如果他拒绝投降 赛昂人可能当即 
If he had refused to surrender, the Cylons would have probably

299
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,010
就会用核弹炸平整个星球
nuked the planet right then and there.

300
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,090
他和赛昂人合作了?  当然
So, did he appear to cooperate with the Cylons? Sure.

301
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,140
其他数百名民众也一样
So did hundreds of others.

302
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,310
他和他们又有什么不同?
What's the difference between him and them?

303
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,110
总统发布了一条集体赦免令
The President issued a blanket pardon.

304
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,990
他们都被赦免了  未被审问
They were all forgiven. No questions asked.

305
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,490
泰上校
Colonel Tigh.

306
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,740
泰上校利用自杀式炸弹袭击者杀死了几十人 被赦免
Colonel Tigh used suicide bombers and killed dozens of people. Forgiven.

307
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,540
阿格森中尉和蒂罗尔轮机长
Lieutenant Agathon and Chief Tyrol.

308
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,830
他们在帕伽索斯上杀害了一名军官 被赦免
They murdered an officer on the Pegasus. Forgiven.

309
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,340
上将 上将针对总统发动了一场…
The Admiral... The Admiral instituted a military coup d'etat

310
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,380
军事政变
against the President.

311
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,170
被赦免
Forgiven.

312
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,930
而我呢?
And me?

313
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,220
呃
Well...

314
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,100
我该从何说起?
Where do I begin?

315
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,480
我击落了一艘民用船
I shot down a civilian passenger ship.

316
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,690
奥林匹克号 船上载有千余名民众 被赦免
The Olympic Carrier. Over a thousand people on board. Forgiven.

317
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,030
我把枪口对准上级  
I raised my weapon to a superior officer.

318
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,490
发动兵变 被赦免
Committed an act of mutiny. Forgiven.

319
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,870
而就在波塔尔向赛昂人俯首称臣的那天
And then, on the very day when Baltar surrendered to those Cylons,

320
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,080
我作为帕伽索斯的指挥官临阵脱逃
I, as commander of the Pegasus, jumped away!

321
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,040
把手无寸铁的民众单独丢在那颗星球上达数月之久
I left everybody on that planet, alone, undefended, for months!

322
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,040
我甚至还劝说上将永远不要回来
I even tried to persuade the Admiral never to return.

323
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,920
为求自保 把你们全丢在这里
To abandon you all there for good.

324
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,090
如果按我说的去做 没人能离开那颗星球
If I'd had my way, nobody would have made it off that planet.

325
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,640
我才是懦夫 我才是叛徒
I'm the coward. I'm the traitor.

326
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,600
而我被赦免了
I'm forgiven.

327
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,900
我不得不说 我们对待错误很宽容
I'd say we're very forgiving of mistakes.

328
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,570
我们制定了自己的法律 自己的司法
We make our own laws now, our own justice,

329
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,530
而从偷窃到谋杀 我们在寻找使大家 
and we've been pretty creative at finding ways to let people off the hook

330
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,900
免受法律制裁的方法上极富创造力
for everything from theft to murder.

331
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,490
我们只能这样 因为…
And we've had to be. Because...

332
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,490
因为我们不再是一个文明的社会
Because we're not a civilization anymore.

333
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,210
我们是一群乌合之众 我们在逃亡
We are a gang. And we're on the run.

334
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,920
我们必须拼命活下来 必须破例  
And we have to fight to survive! We have to break rules!

335
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,050
必须枉法 必须因人而异
We have to bend laws! We have to improvise!

336
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,220
可这次却不行  不行
But not this time. No.

337
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,680
这次不行
Not this time.

338
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,350
对盖尤斯・波塔尔就不行
Not for Gaius Baltar.

339
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,560
不 你!
No. You!

340
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,600
你必须死
You have to die.

341
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,230
你必须死  因为我们非常不喜欢你
You have to die because, well, because we don't like you very much.

342
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,030
因为你自大 因为你软弱
Because you're arrogant. Because you're weak.

343
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,070
因为你是一个孬种
Because you're a coward.

344
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,490
我们是暴民  我们要把你扔出过渡舱
And we, the mob, we want to throw you out the airlock

345
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,080
因为你没有反抗赛昂人 没有光荣牺牲
because you didn't stand up to the Cylons and get yourself killed in the process

346
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,910
这就是现在的司法
That's justice now!

347
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,790
你就应该在新卡布里卡上丧命
You should have been killed back on New Caprica,

348
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,960
可因为你苟且偷生  我们就要处决你
but since you had the temerity to live, we're going to execute you now!

349
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,550
这就是司法!
That's justice!

350
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,010
肃静  肃静
Order. Order!

351
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,060
这个案件...
This case...

352
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,400
是建立在私人情感之上 建立在愤怒…
This case is built on emotion. On anger.

353
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,650
怨恨… 报复之上
Bitterness. Vengeance.

354
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,570
然而最根本的 还是建立在耻辱之上
But most of all, it is built on shame.

355
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,410
是在那颗星球上
It's about the shame

356
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,120
我们对自己人那些所作所为的耻辱
of what we did to ourselves back on that planet.

357
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,750
是我们之中...
And it's about the guilt

358
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,130
那些充当逃兵的人的内疚
of those of us who ran away.

359
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,960
那些充当逃兵的人
Who ran away.

360
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:20,680
而我们却要把全部罪责与耻辱  都推卸到那一个人身上
And we are trying to dump all that guilt and all that shame onto one man,

361
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,810
然后把他冲出过渡舱  
and then flush him out the airlock

362
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,730
希望这一切都随之而去
and hope that, that just gets rid of it all!

363
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,940
这样我们就能够心安理得
So that we can live with ourselves.

364
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,360
这样做是徒劳的
But that won't work.

365
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,860
是徒劳的 那不是公正
That won't work. That's not justice.

366
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,820
对我来说不是
Not to me.

367
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,870
对我来说不是
Not to me.

368
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,800
没有问题了
No further questions.

369
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,880
法官大人 我希望再次重申一下 
Your Honors, I wish to reiterate my strong exception

370
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,720
我强烈反对辩方法律顾问作证
to defense counsel's testimony.

371
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,090
我们已经注意到了
FRANKS: Exception noted.

372
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,260
谢谢
Thank you.

373
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,140
你想诘问证人吗?
Did you want to cross-examine the witness?

374
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,930
我没有问题要问辩方法律顾问
I have no questions for defense counsel.

375
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,690
证人请退庭
FRANKS: Witness is excused.

376
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,650
你还要传唤其他证人吗?
Do you want to call any other witnesses?

377
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,030
法官大人
Your Honors,

378
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,820
我不想再拖延下去了
I don't wish to belabor this any longer.

379
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,660
辩方停止辩护
The defense rests.

380
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,870
很好
FRANKS: Very well.

381
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,160
法庭休庭  商议判决
This court will adjourn to consider a verdict.

382
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,840
这真是法学史上一个辉煌的时刻
What a glorious moment in jurisprudence.

383
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,350
你做得很好
You did a great job.

384
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,400
全体起立
GUARD: All rise!

385
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,680
在宣布判决结果之前  我想先说明一件事
Before I read the verdict, I'd like to make one thing clear.

386
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,430
如同人类一样 司法制度并非尽善尽美
Like everything human, justice is imperfect.

387
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,230
它有瑕疵
It's flawed.

388
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,730
然而正是这些不足之处 
But it's those very imperfections

389
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,400
使得我们有别于那些机器
that separates us from the machines.

390
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,740
甚至可能让我们成为一个值得挽救的物种
And maybe even makes us a species worth saving.

391
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,910
被告请起立
The defendant will rise.

392
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,380
盖尤斯・波塔尔
Gaius Baltar,

393
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,140
在认真权衡证据之后
after carefully weighing the evidence,

394
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,520
本庭以3票对2票的投票结果...
this tribunal, on a vote of three to two,

395
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,230
宣判你无罪
finds you not guilty.

396
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,250
你赢了 当心
You earned it. Watch out.

397
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,330
走吧
Let's go.

398
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,710
我就知道我是无罪的
I always knew that I was going to be acquitted.

399
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,050
但即便判我无罪也无法掩盖...
The fact that I've been found innocent shouldn't disguise in any way

400
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,050
这场审判是 一次彻头彻尾的暗箱操作
that this trial has been a total pantomime.

401
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,260
上将  得把他弄出去!
Admiral! We've got to get him out of here!

402
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,070
下来 让他下来
Down! Get him down!

403
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,200
让他回来  把他弄出去!
Get him back! Get him out of here!

404
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,500
我从一开始就知道总有办法证明...
I knew right from the very start that if there was a way to demonstrate

405
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,500
这一套纯属…  那个词叫什么来着?
the sheer... What's the word I'm looking for?

406
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,710
弄虚作假 我说的就是弄虚作假
"Hypocrisy. " "Hypocrisy" is the word I'm looking for.

407
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,340
控方的证据弄虚作假
Hypocrisy of the prosecution's case,

408
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,720
法官们别无选择  只能判我无罪
then, really, the judges had no other option but to find me not guilty.

409
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,430
你信心十足的样子在整个过程中 
Well, your boundless confidence provided us with great solace

410
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,600
给予我们莫大的安慰
throughout the proceedings.

411
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,020
谢谢你们俩
Look, I want to thank you both.

412
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,270
真的
Truly.

413
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:38,310
我从心底十分感激你们为我所做的一切
From the bottom of my heart. I am very, very grateful

414
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,310
个人来讲...
for all you've done.

415
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,610
我能再看会上将那坐立不安的样子
On a personal note, if I could have seen the Admiral squirm just a little bit more

416
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,360
我也无所谓    你给听好
it wouldn't have hurt. Now, you listen!

417
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,870
别得了便宜还卖乖  博士
Don't push it, Doctor.

418
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,540
好
Fine.

419
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,210
罗默 我们可能应该谈一下
Romo, perhaps we could have a chat.

420
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:06,590
能否在舰队里举行一个签售活动
I've thought about maybe doing a book tour around the fleet.

421
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,430
还有版权问题 
And there's the publishing rights. There are issues about my security,

422
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,390
还有我住行的安全问题
where I'm going to live, what I'm going to do.

423
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,470
既然咱们通过这场审判 建立了这么深厚的友谊
Since we forged this great relationship during the trial,

424
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,520
我想还有谁比你们更…
I thought, you know, who better to... Think about...

425
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,690
事实上  舰队的法律制度已经健全
Actually, now that the fleet's legal system is in place,

426
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,650
其他地方还需要我这不顾他人安危的天份
my not-so-inconsiderable talents are required elsewhere.

427
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,740
所以恐怕我们的缘分到此了
So, I'm afraid this is the end of our journey.

428
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,700
等一下  等…   那我呢?
What? Wait a minute. What... What about me?

429
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,370
请等一下  等等
Wait a minute. Wait. Please.

430
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,670
你们想一下
Think about this for a second.

431
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,460
我要住在哪里?  我该怎么办?
Where am I going to live? What am I going to do?

432
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,260
我要怎么活下去啊?
How am I going to survive?

433
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,220
我不想用"一只猫"的那个比喻  博士
Much as I hate to use a cat metaphor, Doctor,

434
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,640
我想你会找到栖身之所的
I think you'll land on your feet.

435
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,480
出去的时候把门关上
Close the door on your way out.

436
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,780
罗默  还有件事
Romo, one thing...

437
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,950
当你让我出庭作证的时候
When you put me on the stand,

438
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,620
你已经知道结果了么?
did you know what was going to happen?

439
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,380
我知道你是一个诚实的人 亚当玛先生
I knew you were an honest man, Mr. Adama,

440
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,880
一点也不像你的祖父
much unlike your grandfather.

441
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
盖尤斯・波塔尔是无辜的
Gaius Baltar is innocent.

442
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,720
单听这么一说  我都浑身难受
Just the sound of that makes my skin crawl.

443
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,970
无罪并不等于无辜
Not guilty is not the same as innocent.

444
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,770
一定是让你很伤脑筋吧
Must have been particularly difficult for you.

445
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,520
你就...
What, you just...

446
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,980
不能让其他两个人做出让步么?
You couldn't get the other two guys to budge?

447
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,070
你投了无罪  对吧?
You voted for his acquittal, didn't you?

448
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,000
我不想这么说
I hate to say it.

449
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,660
辩方的理由充分
Defense made their case.

450
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,080
控方就不行了
Prosecution didn't.

451
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,670
且不说这次审判的结果 你我都心知肚明
Gaius Baltar is a traitor. We both know that.

452
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,550
盖尤斯・波塔尔是个叛徒 
Regardless of the outcome of his trial.

453
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,900
这并不是说 就让大家忘记…
No one's asking anyone to forget.

454
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,190
或饶恕这一切
Or to forgive.

455
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,490
但我们必须向前看
But we have to look to the future.

456
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,870
盖塔先生    是  长官
Mr. Gaeta. Sir?

457
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,330
开始跳跃准备
Commence jump prep.

458
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,750
我们去爱奥尼亚星云
We're going to the lonian Nebula.

459
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,790
是  长官
Yes, sir.

460
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,350
请原谅
Excuse me.

461
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,190
跳跃坐标已传达完毕  长官
GAETA: Jump coordinates have been distributed, sir.

462
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,230
各船显示D式跳跃阵型
All fleet ships show green for jump formation delta.

463
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,480
开始跳跃
Initiate jump.

464
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,740
是  长官
Aye, sir.

465
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,910
跳跃倒计时 三 二 一
Jumping in three, two, one...

466
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,620
跳跃
Jump.

467
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,830
完成跳跃
GAETA: Jump complete.

468
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,340
各船报告完毕  长官
All fleet ships reporting in, sir.

469
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,340
非常好  盖塔先生
Very well, Mr. Gaeta.

470
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,930
开始雷达扫描
Commence dradis scan.

471
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,470
查看周围情况
Let's see what's out there.

472
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,890
呃
Uh...

473
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,940
哦
Oh...

474
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,240
报告情况     我们的传感器显示有巨大的能量波动
ADAMA: Sitrep! GAETA: Sensors show major power fluctuations.

475
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,830
正检查整个舰队
Checking on fleet.

476
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,960
守卫 两英尺远
MAN: Guards, two feet over!

477
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,930
菜鸟跟我来!  菜鸟跟我来!
RACETRACK: Nuggets on me! Nuggets on me!

478
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,690
有手电筒就 打开
CALLY: If you have a flashlight, turn it on!

479
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,310
检查辅助电源
GAETA: Check auxiliary power.

480
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,440
我们没有辅助电源 只是在靠电池维持
DUALLA: We have negative auxiliary power. We're on batteries only.

481
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,690
做好引擎再启动准备
ADAMA: Get ready for an engine restart.

482
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,850
盖尤斯 别怕  跟我来
Gaius, it's okay. Come with me.

483
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
你们要带我去哪里?
Where are you taking me to?

484
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,770
寻找你的新生 来吧
To your new life. Come on.

485
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,250
来吧!  把电力恢复!
TYROL: Come on, let's get the power back up.

486
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,870
大家动起来  你们知道该怎么做
Come on, people, move it around, you know what to do.

487
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,150
大家靠在一起
RACETRACK: Come on. Get yourself together!

488
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
一定有出去的办法
There must be some kind of way out of here.

489
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,280
小心脚下  
RACETRACK: Be careful where you walk.

490
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,490
到处都是设备 都是连电的
There's lots of equipment around. It's all live.

491
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,710
小丑对小偷如是说
Said the joker to the thief.

492
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,720
这里混乱不堪
There's too much confusion here.

493
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,490
让我一刻不得闲
I can't get no relief.

494
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,290
这不是真的
This isn't happening.

495
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,840
求你告诉我这不是真的
Please, tell me this isn't happening.

496
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,180
原来如此
So, that's it.

497
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,230
在历尽艰险之后
After all this time.

498
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,730
开关就这样一变
A switch goes off just like that.

499
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,690
哇
Whoa!

500
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,950
不是吧
No way.

501
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,660
我不信 我才不信 这是…
I don't believe this. I'm not buying this. This is...

502
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,620
这是骗人的把戏  拜托  我们可不是…
It's a trick. Come on, we're not...

503
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,050
那是什么…
What is that...

504
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,880
那首曲子是什么来着?
What is that song?

505
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,580
妈了个巴子的!  够了!
All right! That's enough, Gods damn it!

506
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,840
把门都他妈的锁上!
Deadbolt that frakking door!

507
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,060
入伍40年
Forty years in the service.

508
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,690
40年
Forty years.

509
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
参加过两次大战
Two wars.

510
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
参与作战
Combat.

511
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,610
在新卡布里卡上被关在那座地牢里
Locked in that dungeon on New Caprica.

512
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,200
艾伦
Ellen.

513
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,080
我的天
My Gods...

514
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,250
那艾伦又算作是什么?
What about Ellen?

515
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,920
不  不
No, no, no.

516
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,630
不可能
Not after all this.

517
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
不可能在反抗...
Not after the Resistance

518
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,090
和占领之后还会这样
and the occupation.

519
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:22,560
看着我的朋友一个个死去  就是他妈为了这个结果?
Not after watching my friends die, one after another, for frakking this?

520
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,100
山姆… 离我远点
Sam... You stay the hell away from me.

521
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,810
你们都他妈离我远点
You all just stay the frak away from me.

522
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,060
山姆
Sam...

523
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,360
是真的
It's true.

524
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,610
我们是赛昂人
We're Cylons.

525
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,870
从一开始就是
And we have been from the start.

526
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,670
上将  这是怎么回事?
ROSLIN: Admiral, what's going on?

527
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,800
好象是电涌吧
Some kind of power surge.

528
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,260
立即给我损坏报告
Give me a damage report, immediately.

529
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,050
断电是整个舰队范围的
The power outage is fleet-wide, Admiral.

530
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,770
所有船只几乎是同时恢复电力
It was also simultaneously restored to all ships.

531
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,310
上将 上将!
Admiral. Admiral!

532
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,650
雷达上出现目标
Dradis contact!

533
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,190
拦截航道上出现大规模赛昂舰队
Massive Cylon fleet on intercept course!

534
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,530
盖塔先生  立即下令各就各位
Mr. Gaeta, sound action stations immediately.

535
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,610
副长  全体舰队紧急跳跃
XO, I want emergency jump for the entire fleet.

536
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,070
长官 全体舰队在断电期间都消耗了动力
Sir, all fleet ships were powered down during the outage.

537
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,700
至少要用20分钟才能启动超光速引擎
It will take at least 20 minutes to spool up the FTL drives.

538
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,040
我们没有20分钟
We just don't have 20 minutes.

539
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,210
各就各位  各就各位
Action stations, action stations,

540
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,620
全体舰队一级戒备  
set Condition 1 throughout the ship.
