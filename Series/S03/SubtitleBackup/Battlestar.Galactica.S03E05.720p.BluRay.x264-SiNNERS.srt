1
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,480
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》 前情提要
GAETA: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,020
你会用你的双臂拥抱我
You're gonna hold me in your arms,

3
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,860
你会说你爱我
you're gonna tell me that you love me.

4
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,440
你疯了
You're insane.

5
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,450
你杀了我  我下载到新的躯壳  我回来  我们从新开始
You kill me, I download. I come back, we start over.

6
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,280
我不属于这里  让我出去!
I don't belong here! Let me out!

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,540
有些人加入了赛昂人的警察部门
Some of those guys who joined up with the Cylon police,

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,040
你知道他们是不可理喻的
I bet they're in over their heads, you know?

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,040
如果有一天  这一切都结束了
One day, when this is all over,

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,380
类似盖塔这样的人都会被绞死
guys like that are gonna get strung up.

11
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,710
而像你我这样的人  则是负责
Guys like you and me,

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,380
将绳子打结的人  把绳子绑得紧紧的
we're gonna be there, tying the knots, making them tight.

13
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,010
你从哪里得到的这玩意?  谁是你的情报源?
Where are you getting this stuff? Who's your source?

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,260
我不知道  消息源没有透露他们的名字
I have no idea. The source won't tell me what their name is.

15
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,930
也许这样对大家更安全
It's probably safer for all of us.

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,060
总统先生?
Mr. President?

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,140
早上好  盖塔
Good morning, Gaeta.

18
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,770
这是一份死刑判决书  你看过这个名单上的人名吗?
This is a death warrant. Have you seen the names on this list?

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,440
你知道他们会有什么反应吗?
Do you have any idea what they're about to do out there?

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,913
我从"死亡投递点"那里拿到这个
I got this from the dead drop, 

21
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:13,400
是从管理部门的线人那里得来的
from the source in the administration.

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,940
这是张死亡名单  而凯莉的名字就在上面
It's a death list and Cally's name is on it.

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,320
走 别向后看
Run, don't look back. Go!

24
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,490
掩护
Take cover!

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,080
我们在汇合点遭到埋伏
SAM: We were ambushed at the rendezvous.

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,160
赛昂人确切知道我们所在的位置
The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.

27
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,620
那并不能说明艾伦...         我什么也没干
That doesn't mean Ellen... I didn't do anything!

28
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,290
这是那张我画给你的地图
This is the map that I drew for you.

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,090
你本应该烧掉的  但你妻子说帮你去烧
You were gonna burn it, but then your wife offered to do it for you.

30
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,420
你知道自己该做什么的
You know what has to be done here.

31
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,680
为了她好  还是由你来做
Now, it would be better for her sake if it was you.

32
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,680
快点  跟上!
Come on! Move! Move, move!

33
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,020
从整个设施中撤退
Evacuate the entire facility.

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,850
你也应该和我们一起走  盖尤斯  我们也给你留了个位置
You should go as well, Gaius. There's a place for you, too.

35
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,200
快走
CONNOR: Walk.

36
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,520
以下指控的证据已上报给特别法庭
Evidence for the following charges have been presented to the Circle,

37
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,480
你和敌人狼狈为奸
that you carried arms for the enemy,

38
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,150
你实施的多起搜捕行动都是针对人类的 
that you carried out multiple raids against the human population,

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,450
在其中一起搜捕过程中 有23人被你和你的人杀害
and that during one raid, 23 people were killed by you and your men

40
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,450
就是在你们侵犯阿尔提米斯神庙的时候
during the assault on the Temple of Artemis.

41
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,950
那不是事实
It's not true!

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,460
这些是被你所杀的人的名单
These are the names of the people killed by you and those under your command.

43
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,920
你看看这些名单!
You look at those names!

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,250
康纳
SEELIX: Connor.

45
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,550
特别法庭核查了证据 认定你有叛国罪
The Circle has examined the evidence and found you guilty of treason

46
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,090
与反人类罪
and crimes against humanity.

47
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,600
在判决前  你还有什么要说的吗?
Do you have anything to say before sentence is passed?

48
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,390
我只是想帮助他们
I was trying to help people.

49
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,640
你干的活可不是一个好活  对吧?
You didn't do a very good job then, did you?

50
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,310
就让我们结束吧
All right, let's just get this over with.

51
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,440
我帮助过他们  我帮助过好多人啊
I helped people. I helped lots of people!

52
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,900
军士长...军士长!军士长  我帮过凯莉  我救了凯莉
Chief? Chief? Chief, I helped Cally. I saved Cally.

53
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,910
我救了凯莉
I saved Cally!

54
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,200
"你救了凯莉"是什么意思?? 
What do you mean, you helped Cally?

55
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,290
是我...是我...是我救的她
I'm the one. I'm the one who did...

56
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,000
是我在他们射击前让她跑的
I'm the one who let her go when they were gonna shoot her.

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,540
我让她离开车队  我说:"现在快跑  拼命跑  离开这里"
I took her out of line. I said, "Go, run right now, get out of here. "

58
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,370
她做到了  她跑开了
And she did. She ran and she got away.

59
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,750
是我  军士长  我救的凯莉
Because of me, Chief. I helped Cally. I saved Cally.

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,920
凯莉确实是跑开了
Cally did get away somehow.

61
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,930
他们在那次神庙搜捕中杀害了23人!
Well, they killed 23 people during the Temple raids,

62
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,310
12个男人  8个女人  和3个孩子
12 men, eight women and three children.

63
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,930
还有孩子!
Children!

64
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,980
我的儿子就在这名单里!
My son is on this list!

65
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,520
他的名字就在这!
His name is right there,

66
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,150
不知是哪个龟孙子把他加上的
and that frakking son of a bitch put him there.

67
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,280
那么  救了凯莉  就算是的话
So, saving Cally, if that happened,

68
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,610
就能弥补杀死我儿子的过错吗?
does that make up for killing my son?

69
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,830
回答  军士长
Answer the question, Chief.

70
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,500
是否救了凯莉 就能让他杀了23个人吗?
Does saving Cally let him off the hook for killing 23 others?

71
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,730
是你做的吗  杰米? 是你杀了这些人吗?
Did you do this, Jammer? Did you kill these people?

72
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,020
回答我
Answer me.

73
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,150
你知道那里的人都疯了  军士长
It was crazy down there, Chief.

74
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,030
你知道的
You know that.

75
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,830
你们做这个决定太仓促了
You make these decisions so fast.

76
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,620
当你们在追捕时 那些人站出来  举着双手
You're making an arrest, and people come out with their hands up.

77
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,120
但有些时候  那只是个诡计
But sometimes that's just a trick.

78
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,290
他们说他们投降了  但接着  他们却开枪了
They tell you they're surrendering, and then they open fire.

79
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,800
我们以为他们是起义军的
We thought they were insurgents.

80
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,970
在我们看到他们的尸体时  才知道不是
It wasn't until after, when we saw the bodies...

81
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,060
那我该如何做呢?
What was I supposed to do?

82
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,730
不  不能抵消罪过
No, it doesn't.

83
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,910
根据法律条文 叛国罪是判死刑
Under the Articles, the punishment for treason is death.

84
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,330
现在确认宣判  
Sentence confirmed

85
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,580
并在今天执行 第二次逃亡后的第三天
and carried out on this, the third day of the Second Exodus.

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,090
军士长
Chief...

87
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,180
我错了!
I'm sorry!

88
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,550
你妈的话太多了
There's too much frakking talk.

89
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,770
等等!
Wait.

90
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,830
我错了
I'm sorry!

91
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,790
我儿子...
CONNOR: My son.

92
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,290
凯文
Kevin.

93
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,670
他只有7岁啊
He was only seven years old.

94
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,050
我们走吧
Let's go.

95
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,170
快点
Come on.

96
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,180
康纳  我们走吧
Connor, let's go.

97
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,100
这不是我想参加的
This isn't what I signed up for.

98
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,080
我看不见
GIRL: I can't see.

99
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,750
妈妈
Mom...

100
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,540
好小伙子
Good boy.

101
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,550
好小伙子
Good boy.

102
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,420
嗨 亲爱的
Hey, sweetie.

103
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,090
我还需要被照顾吗?
Am I on watch?

104
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,930
不  不  你很好
No, no, you're fine.

105
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,640
来  让我抱抱  过来  你过来
Here, give him to me. Come here. You come here.

106
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,310
到爸爸这来 嗨  小宝贝  接到你了
Come to Daddy. Oh, hey, buddy. Hey, buddy, there you go.

107
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,610
我知道 妈妈比我抱更舒服  对吧?
I know. Mommy's much more comfortable than me, huh?

108
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,400
凯莉?        嗯
Cally? Mmm-hmm?

109
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,700
你在那个星球的时候
When you were down on the planet,

110
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,120
你从卡车旁跑走
you ran away from the trucks,

111
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,460
是有人帮你吗?
did anybody help you?

112
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,880
是一个NCP警察还是别人呢? (译者注:NCP新卡布里卡警察)
One of the NCP goons or anybody?

113
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,800
什么?  没有
What? No.

114
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,720
等下  是有个
Wait. Yeah.

115
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
有人让我快跑
Somebody told me to run.

116
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,440
那可能是一个NCP警察吧
It probably was one of those goons.

117
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,270
那以后我还没想过呢
But I haven't thought about it since.

118
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,950
嗨  你怎么知道的呢?
Hey, how did you know about that?

119
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,620
我意思是  你为什么问呢?
I mean, why do you ask?

120
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,370
没什么 快睡吧
No reason. Go back to sleep.

121
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,630
好的
Okay.

122
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,810
在我看来  那不是他的错
In my opinion, it wasn't his fault.

123
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,600
我虽不愿意承认  但上将是对的
I hate to admit it, but the Admiral's right.

124
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,940
他是在一个极端困难的情况下
He was in an impossible situation.

125
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,110
如果我是他  可能我也会那样
I'd have probably done the same in his position.

126
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,700
那好  如果那是必须的  那这种行为也是无可厚非的
Well, if that's the way it has to be, then that's the way it has to be.

127
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,490
感觉不糟吗?
No hard feelings?

128
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,740
没有
None.

129
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,130
错误已经发生  不用怀疑  没有任何疑问
Mistakes were made. Of that, there's no question.

130
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,670
但是过去的...
But the past

131
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,760
已经过去了
is the past.

132
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,470
我想大家都会同意我们应该继续前进
I think we can all agree that we'd like to move on.

133
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,810
你们被愚弄了 你们太仁慈了  
You fools. You're being too lenient.

134
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,650
他背叛了你们  他想让你们去死 
He betrayed you, actively sought your deaths.

135
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,490
你们还觉得没关系吗?   你们还有自尊吗?
Doesn't that matter to you? Don't you have any self-respect?

136
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,570
别打岔了  他们听不到你的
I wouldn't bother. They can't hear you.

137
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,910
不要让我发火  盖尤斯
Don't make me angry, Gaius.

138
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,080
她发火时  你不会喜欢他的
You wouldn't like her when she's angry.

139
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,910
不
No.

140
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,290
我一直想要你
ROSLIN: I've always wanted you.

141
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,880
噢  不
Oh, no.

142
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,220
什么?
What?

143
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,050
我是在做梦  对吧?
I'm dreaming, aren't I?

144
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,600
是的  你是在梦里
Yes, you are.

145
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,700
嗨
Hey.

146
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,460
你睡过觉了吗?
Did you get any sleep?

147
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,540
在你死的时候睡的
Sleep when you're dead.

148
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,840
不错
Nice.

149
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,050
那东西都是些什么?
What is all that?

150
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,140
我找回了我储备室里面的一些东西
I got my gear out of storage.

151
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,560
从来都没想过还能见到它们
I never thought I'd see any of this stuff again.

152
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,850
嗨
Hey.

153
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,560
什么     过来
What? Come here.

154
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,820
别这样  行吗?
Just don't, okay?

155
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,530
打扰了  伙计
WOMAN: Excuse me, guys.

156
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,920
那么  总统先生
So, Mr. President,

157
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,720
新12殖民地法人还有多久宣誓就职?
how long before the new Quorum of Twelve can be sworn in?

158
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,180
3天
Three days.

159
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,430
我会以个人名义提名你作我的副总统
I will personally place your name in nomination as my vice president.

160
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,560
当他们承认你后  我会提出辞职  然后你宣誓就职
Once they confirm you, I submit my resignation and you get sworn in.

161
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,480
整个过程不会超过一个小时
I think it should take less than an hour.

162
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,755
你就这样下台  也不搏一次了?  
You're stepping down without a fight.

163
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,400
我的意思是汤姆・查莱克可以要些东西
 It means Tom Zarek wants something.

164
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,690
你何不亮出自己的底牌
So why don't you put your cards on the table,

165
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,240
让我看看  那是不是一个我愿意付的价码
and let's see if it's a price that I'm willing to pay?

166
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,160
我是一个现实主义者
Well, I'm a realist.

167
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,620
我对在这个办公室长久待下去从不抱幻想
I never had any illusions about remaining in office for very long.

168
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,460
并且上将显然也会认为 
And the Admiral's made it quite clear

169
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,333
没什么会比把我扔进监狱更好了
that he'd like nothing better than to put me 

170
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:46,130
如果我尽力的话
in a cell if I try to hang onto power.

171
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,220
他会给你一个人情的
He's trying to do you a favor.

172
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,590
你和我都很清楚 没有军队的支持
You and I both know how impossible it would be to govern this fleet

173
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,600
来管辖这个舰队是不可能的
without the backing of the military.

174
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,100
我同意  这是我们在此的原因
I agree. That's why we're here.

175
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,180
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

176
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,940
就算这样  我还想在新政府里干点什么
Even so, I want to be included in the new government.

177
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,190
我不再想做一个外人  无关者
I don't want to be on the outside looking in anymore.

178
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,240
好吧
Okay.

179
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,280
好吧
Okay.

180
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,370
你在新卡布里卡反对波塔尔
You stood up to Baltar on New Caprica.

181
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,540
为此你差点就丢了命
You nearly lost your life for your trouble.

182
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,380
这个舰队需要这种勇气
This fleet needs that kind of courage.

183
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,720
副总统的职位就是你的  只要你想的话  汤姆
The vice presidency is yours if you want it, Tom.

184
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,850
好  谢谢你
Well, thank you.

185
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,100
乐意之极
You're welcome.

186
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,910
你是开玩笑吧
You've got to be kidding me.

187
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,290
谁许可这家伙进作战指挥中心的?
Who gave this man permission to enter the CIC?

188
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,960
上将的命令  先生
Admiral's orders, sir.

189
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,000
通信系统在拯救行动时遭到了严重破坏
Communications took some serious hits during the rescue,

190
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,260
盖塔先生过来帮忙修复这些故障
and Mr. Gaeta's offered to help with repairs.

191
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,130
这样  很好啊
Well, isn't that nice?

192
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,510
一个人能够叛变  伙同敌人一起
A man can turn his coat, collaborate with the enemy,

193
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,810
造成了数千人的死亡
contribute to the deaths of thousands,

194
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,480
但是老头子就为了修电话  突然间  所有这一切都可以赦免
but the old man needs his phones fixed, and suddenly all is forgiven.

195
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,730
赛昂人会找到我们 我们必须利用所有能用的力量
HELO: The Cylons find us, we're gonna need every hand we've got.

196
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,400
等赛昂人找到我们  阿格森先生
The Cylons found us, Mr. Agathon.

197
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,230
你的朋友盖塔会在欢迎委员会里的
Your friend Gaeta was on the welcoming committee.

198
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,280
听着!看着我
Hey! Look at me!

199
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,820
你现在在这儿  看来可以帮帮我的忙
As long as you're here, maybe you can help me out.

200
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,500
在我被拘留期间  我失去了一些东西
I'm missing something. I lost it in detention.

201
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,790
就在你做赛昂人小乖乖的时候
Since you're so buddy-buddy with the Cylons,

202
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,500
可能你知道它在哪里吧?
maybe you know where it is.

203
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,090
如何?
How about it?

204
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,170
你知道我的眼睛在哪里吗?
Do you know where my eye is?

205
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,550
少!
ADAMA: Saul!

206
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,340
上将
TIGH: Admiral.

207
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,300
都回去工作
Back to work.

208
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,890
跟我走        是
Walk with me. Yeah.

209
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,570
在今后的两周时间里  有很多工作要做
We have a lot of work in the next couple of weeks.

210
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,950
我需要你睡觉休息 休息好  准备好  好吗?
I need you to get some sleep. Get rest, get ready, all right?

211
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,160
哦  我现在就准备好了
Oh, I'm ready right now.

212
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,740
我可能稍微有点过火了 但我能把握住的
I may be a little rough around the edges, but I can still hold my own.

213
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,120
你可以告诉那个烤面包机爱好者
And you can tell that toaster lover over there

214
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,620
我还是这艘船的副长!
that I'm still the XO of this ship!

215
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,710
我们走吧
ADAMA: Let's go.

216
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,750
别碰我
Get your hands off me.

217
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,630
你正在让你自己难堪  少
You're embarrassing yourself, Saul.

218
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,880
你才是那个该不好意思的
You're the one that should be embarrassed,

219
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,590
让一个波塔尔的党羽到处乱走
letting one of Baltar's henchmen

220
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,260
就像什么都没发生一样
walk around like nothing's happened.

221
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,720
去睡觉  马上!  这是个命令
Go sleep this off. That's an order.

222
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,810
噢  好吧  就去睡觉
Oh, yeah, just go to sleep,

223
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,270
忘了所有的 那就忘了所有发生的事情
forget about it all, just forget about everything.

224
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,690
但是我不会忘记的!  我不打算忘记!
Well, I'm not forgetting. I'm not gonna forget!

225
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,130
这个控状是在战争中为敌人
The charges are carrying arms for the enemy in a time of war,

226
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,800
开枪射击3名平民  并且通敌
shooting three civilians and collaboration with the enemy.

227
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,510
现在投票
I call the vote.

228
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,800
有罪
Guilty.

229
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,600
有罪
Guilty.

230
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,220
有罪 有罪
Guilty. Guilty.

231
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,640
嗯  有罪
Yeah, guilty.

232
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,270
有罪
Guilty.

233
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,320
表决意见一致  判决死刑
The vote being unanimous, the sentence is death.

234
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,780
查得维克在Monarch号上
Chadwick's aboard the Monarch.

235
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,150
我会通知我们那边的人  他会处理的
I'll contact our man there. He'll take care of it.

236
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,320
谁有香烟?
Has anybody got a cigarette?

237
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,570
还剩多少人?
TYROL: How many more of these do we got?

238
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,120
57人   三天了  我不敢想象这三天我们是如何过的
Fifty-seven. Three days. I can't believe that's all the time we've got.

239
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,000
那就不要再抱怨了
TIGH: Then stop wasting it, bitching and moaning.

240
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,080
在我们参加的时候  都知道这是有时限的
We all knew there was a clock when we signed on.

241
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,460
他们绝大多数都是有罪的  太恶劣了
Most of these fraks are so guilty, they stink.

242
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,300
我可以在一个小时内把50个叛完
I could get through 50 of these things in an hour.

243
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,130
你以为我们是一群暴徒?
You think we're a bunch of thugs

244
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,380
一时兴起就决定处决人吗?
handing out punishment on a whim?

245
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,640
杰米没有活下来 因为你认为他是有罪的
Jammer didn't get air-locked because you thought he was guilty.

246
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,390
有证据你看到了那个报告
There was evidence. You read the witness reports.

247
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,980
他想辩解  但是被这个法庭判有罪
He was tried and convicted by this Circle.

248
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,270
这是关系到正义的事情  你懂吗?   正义!
This is about justice. You got that? Justice!

249
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,980
好的  是  是
Yeah, okay. Okay.

250
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,990
嗨  不要让我找到错误
Hey, now don't get me wrong here.

251
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,370
我喜欢你  康纳  你是个好人
I like you, Connor, you're a good guy.

252
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,700
下一个
Next case.

253
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,870
菲里克斯・盖塔
SEELIX: Felix Gaeta.

254
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,300
指控是通敌罪 反人类罪
Charges are collaborating with the enemy and crimes against humanity.

255
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,020
我不想判这个   你以为我喜欢吗?
I don't want to do this! You think I like it?

256
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,030
我和盖塔在作战指挥中心共事了4年  像一家人
I stood beside Gaeta in the CIC for almost four years. He was like family.

257
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,700
但现实是他是盖尤斯的首脑官员
But the fact remains he was the Chief of Staff to Gaius Baltar,

258
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,280
仅这一项就够指控他了
and that alone is enough to convict him.

259
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,280
依我说  在这个家伙身上
And I'm saying that on this particular guy,

260
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,870
我们找不到任何有力的证据
we do not have any hard evidence.

261
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,700
我们找不到目击证人  什么也没有
We have no witnesses, nothing.

262
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,250
我们所知道的就是他为波塔尔工作  就这些
All we do know is that he worked for Baltar. That's it.

263
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,880
是的  我同意山姆的说法  我们需要详细的证据
Yeah, yeah. I've got to go with Sam on this one. We need something specific.

264
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,720
你要详细的?  你以为会是波塔尔出主意吗? 那家伙?
You want specific? You think Baltar ran things, that guy?

265
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
他只是个傀儡  
He was the public face.

266
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,340
但是盖塔  他才是主脑  所有人都知道
But Gaeta, he was the brains, everyone knew that.

267
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:31,100
都是他具体操作 是他准备的文书 他批准的处决名单
He ran the operation, he did the paperwork. He approved the death lists...

268
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,560
那你是怎么知道的呢?  你在那儿吗?
How do you know that? Were you there?

269
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,980
你看到他批准让哪一个被处决了吗?
Did you see him approve one single death list?

270
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,400
他知道凯莉在处决名单上
He knew Cally was on the death list.

271
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,030
你说什么?  你怎么知道的?
What are you talking about? How do you know that?

272
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,410
看这里 这是执行的名单 凯莉的名字在这
Look there. That's a distribution list, and there's Cally's name.

273
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,410
这里有盖塔的名字
And there's Gaeta's name.

274
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,460
他看到了她的处决命令
He saw her execution order.

275
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,920
那也只是迫于形势
It's still all circumstantial.

276
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,092
当他看到这个名单的时候
We don't know what Gaeta did or 

277
00:20:57,093 --> 00:20:58,880
我们不知道盖塔做了什么和没有做什么
didn't do when he saw that list.

278
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,590
我同意他们的说法
Jean. I gotta go with them on this one, Sam.

279
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,872
不  山姆  当你看到这样一份死亡名单
No, Sam, you see a death list like that, 

280
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:04,380
你知道无辜的人将会被处决
you know innocent people are gonna die,

281
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,340
你会不做点什么吗?  你有罪
and you do nothing about it? You're guilty.

282
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,020
我要求表决
I call the question.

283
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:18,020
表决菲里克斯・盖塔是否有罪已被要求
The question of the innocence or guilt of Felix Gaeta has been called.

284
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,480
特别法庭将表决
The Circle will vote.

285
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,030
我判他有罪
I vote guilty.

286
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,320
有罪
CONNOR: Guilty.

287
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,700
有罪
Guilty.

288
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,490
山姆?
SEELIX: Sam?

289
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,700
不  别烦我  我做完该做的了
No, don't bother. I'm done.

290
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,790
我们继续表决        我不干!
We're still voting. I'm not.

291
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,290
我做完了  我做完所有自己该做的了
I'm done. I'm done with this whole thing.

292
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,750
战争对我来说已经结束了  对不起
The war's over for me. I'm sorry.

293
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,460
好吧  那好吧
Okay, that's fine.

294
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,130
现在是四票对零票  军士长  你的判定呢?
It's still four to none, Chief. What's your vote?

295
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,800
不  等下  我们需要6个人表决的 
No, wait a minute. We need six votes.

296
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,220
不  别管它         不  别管你才是!
No, screw you! No. Screw that.

297
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,020
我们是审判团  那是我们的规矩  我们必须要6个人表决
We're a jury, that's how it was set up! We need six votes.

298
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,270
我们现在不满6人  我也不干了
Without six votes, I'm out, too.

299
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,480
他是对的  我们需要6个人
He's right. We need a sixth.

300
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,710
你好吗  盖尤斯?
How are you, Gaius?

301
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,630
我还活着
I'm alive.

302
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,260
我想是还活着
I suppose that's something.

303
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,110
谢谢你
Thank you.

304
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,750
可能要打搅你一下  我有点迷糊了
You'll have to excuse me. I'm slightly confused.

305
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,170
我在这里待了多久了?
How long have I been here, exactly?

306
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,670
3天
Three days.

307
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,720
3天?
Three days?

308
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,390
你们3天后才想到我在哪?
So, it's taken you three days to remember where I was?

309
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,680
没人忘了你的  盖尤斯
No one's forgotten you, Gaius.

310
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,600
只是关于是否该让你上船
It's just there's been some controversy about

311
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,020
有些争论
whether or not you should have been let on board or not.

312
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,230
我简直不能想象还有人在质疑我的价值
I can't believe there's still a question of my value.

313
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,650
那肯定会是个问题的  
There will always be a question.

314
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,530
你是一个人类
You are a human.

315
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,780
现在  你看
Now, look.

316
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,870
我帮过你
I helped you.

317
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,670
我把莎伦的孩子给了你
I gave you Sharon's child.

318
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,250
是  没错  确实是你
Yes, that's right, you did.

319
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,340
而且救了那孩子也给你加了分
And the child's rescue did weigh in your favor.

320
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,550
但是  投票也陷入了僵局
However, the vote's deadlocked.

321
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,770
有三个同意你应该被留下 另外三个反对
Three in favor of your being allowed to stay, and three against.

322
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,310
还有一个型号没有表态
With one model still undecided.

323
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,730
事实上  最后的决定取决于6号
The fact is the decision rests with the Sixes.

324
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,250
我们在准备粗略的失踪人口报告
We're starting to see a rash of missing persons reports.

325
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,790
嗯  我们在那个星球上留下了数千人
Well, we left thousands of people on that planet.

326
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,380
不  不对  有些人是确认生还的
No, this is different. These are people known to have survived,

327
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,800
但是有些是在逃亡后失踪的 比如说像杰米
but who have gone missing since the exodus. Jammer, for instance.

328
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,180
那个甲板手 昨天下午我还看到他的
Deckhand? I saw him yesterday afternoon.

329
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,430
是的  但他今天早上的集合就没有他
Yeah, but he didn't report at muster this morning.

330
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,640
卧室里没有  医务室里也没有  就像他突然消失了一样
Bed-check negative, sickbay negative, it's like he just vanished.

331
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,390
有多少人失踪?
How many people are missing?

332
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,480
今天有13人  卡拉狄加上两人.别的地方有11人
Thirteen, as of today. Two on Galactica, 11 elsewhere.

333
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,320
他们中所有人都是被确认过生还的
Every one of them confirmed as a survivor by multiple witnesses,

334
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,490
但是没了
and then, poof, gone.

335
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,950
有这个"失踪人口"案的新进展就告诉我
Keep me posted on any more missing persons.

336
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,330
我想知道怎么回事
I want to know about it.

337
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,080
是  长官  现在如果您允许的话
Yes, sir. Now, if you'll excuse me,

338
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,420
我有一个跳绳的约会
I have a date with a jump rope.

339
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,170
嗨  我已经减了不少了
Hey, I've dropped half a stone.

340
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,090
继续跳吧
Keep jumping.

341
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,790
嗨
Hey.

342
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,590
你过得如何?
How you doing?

343
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,800
你知道的  还好吧  你呢?
Oh, you know, I'm making do. How are you?

344
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,010
我不错啊  你为什么问呢?
I'm good. Why do you ask?

345
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,060
嗯  我听过你的情况  你被…
Well, I heard about your situation. You were...

346
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,310
没错
Right.

347
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,850
我在尝试不再想起那件事  知道吗?
I just try not to think about it anymore, you know?

348
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,320
有一点像你...
You know, I'm kind of like you,

349
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,490
坐在豪华的殖民地一号的办公室里
sitting in your cushy little office on Colonial One,

350
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,370
帮波塔尔干那些肮脏的事
doing all of Baltar's dirty work for him.

351
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,000
可能从来没有想过在我身上正发生着什么事情  对吧?
You probably never even thought about what was happening to me, right?

352
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,130
我不知道你的情况
I didn't know about your situation.

353
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,210
如果我知道的话  我会设法让你出去的
If I had, I would have tried to get you out.

354
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,340
嗯
Mmm.

355
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,930
就像我现在都说了50遍的话
And like I've just said about 50 times now,

356
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,840
我效力的是联邦的合法总统
I was serving the legal President of the Colonies.

357
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,970
我们都选了他的  记得吗?
We all elected him, remember?

358
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,310
那么  这就可以宽恕你吗?
Is that supposed to excuse it?

359
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,640
你想让我说什么?
What do you want me to say?

360
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,850
也许我可以做得更多
Maybe I could have done more.

361
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,900
但当赛昂人着陆的时候
But I thought that when the Cylons landed,

362
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,780
我继续工作是很重要的 可以从内部帮助大家
it was important for me to keep my job, to help from the inside.

363
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,530
就靠支持波塔尔 并让赛昂人压迫我们？
By propping Baltar up and letting the Cylons walk all over us?

364
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,950
不是的! 不是的!  我给抵抗组织传递消息
No, no. I fed information to the Resistance.

365
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,330
是我设立了"死亡投递点"  那是一个狗食盆
I set up dead drops. There was a dog bowl.

366
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,830
是我透露了赛昂人刑场的位置 通过内部备忘录
I passed along Cylon positions, internal memoranda...

367
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,710
万岁  菲里克斯
Right, Felix.

368
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,540
你真是个该死的英雄
You're a frakkin' hero.

369
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,750
我必须要结束对你的感情
Whatever feelings I had for you have to stop.

370
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,710
我的感情干扰到了我的判断
I allowed my feelings to cloud my judgment.

371
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,340
我保护了你
I protected you.

372
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,800
我给了你第二次机会
I gave your species a second chance.

373
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,140
我甚至反对我们的赛昂人姐妹  都为了什么?
I even turned against a sister Cylon, and for what?

374
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,220
我是个赛昂人  盖尤斯
I'm Cylon, Gaius.

375
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,980
不知为什么我都忘了自己是赛昂人
Somehow I lost sight of that.

376
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,780
你不仅仅是一个机器
You are much, much more than a machine.

377
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,820
你是一个人
You're a person.

378
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,200
一个真实的人
A real person.

379
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,700
一个女人
A woman.

380
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,540
并且在和我相爱
And you're in love with me.

381
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,130
并且这让人心痛
And it hurts.

382
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,960
我知道这让人心痛
I know it hurts.

383
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,420
但是相信我
But believe me,

384
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,640
我是唯一能让它好起来的人 你没看到吗?
I am the only one that can make it better, don't you see?

385
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,550
我是唯一的
I am the only one.

386
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,810
不  需要结束这一切
No. This has to end.

387
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,480
你需要我 你需要我!承认吧!
You need me! You need me, admit it! Admit it, you need me!

388
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,990
我也需要你!
And I need you, too!

389
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,320
你听到了吗?  我也需要你
Did you hear me? I need you, too!

390
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,580
也许我之前应该从那开始
Maybe I should've started with that.

391
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,260
这是一个审判团  我需要大家明确这一点
This is a jury. I want to make that clear.

392
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,300
这不是什么评分或人身评定
It's not about settling scores or personal grudges.

393
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,510
这是个审判团
It's a jury.

394
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,180
我们处理的都是人渣中的人渣
And we're just dealing with the worst of the worst.

395
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,390
那些比穿上NCP警服或与
People that did more than put on an NCP uniform

396
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,100
赛昂人地下交易做孽更多的人
or make a deal with the Cylons.

397
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,610
他们是杀人犯  他们才是真正的叛国者
They're the killers, the real traitors.

398
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,700
哦  但这一切都是非法的  对吧?
Yeah, but none of this is legal, right?

399
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,070
不  不  这是合法的
No, no. It's legal.

400
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,120
你一定是在和我开玩笑
STARBUCK: You've got to be kidding me.

401
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,750
那是我们现在为什么需要了解 你加入还是不加入?
That's why we need to know right now, are you in or out?

402
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,970
加入
In.

403
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,260
好
Good.

404
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,310
我们都已经审查通过这项证据 所以 看你的吧
We've already been through the evidence, so just take your time.

405
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,480
你是说盖塔看过这个名单 并且没有做任何事情?
You're telling me that Gaeta saw this list and didn't do a damned thing about it?

406
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,422
当他看到这个名单的时候 
We have no idea of knowing what

407
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:29,200
我们不知道盖塔做了什么或是没有做什么
 Gaeta did or did not do when he saw the list.

408
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,990
我的天  整件事就像一个噩梦
My Gods, the whole thing's like a bad dream,

409
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,370
只是我们都醒来了  可叛国贼还在那儿
only we woke up and the traitors are all still here.

410
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,920
有罪
Guilty.

411
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,840
现在的有罪判断是五比零
The vote's five to none in favor of guilty.

412
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,050
这是没有异议的
It's got to be unanimous.

413
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:49,050
军士长 你是最后一个评判的
Chief, you're the last to vote.

414
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,010
离开这里  山姆
Get out of here, Sam.

415
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,350
我想和我老婆说句话 我要现在说
I'd like to talk to my wife. I'd like to do it now.

416
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,900
你已经评判过了  休息一下吧
We already have your vote. Take a break.

417
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,370
听着  我退出是因为我不想继续杀人
Hey, I quit because I'm not looking for ways to keep killing people.

418
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,790
但我需要  山姆
Well, I need this, Sam.

419
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,040
又能怎么样呢?
So what?

420
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,580
把人们从减压舱中丢出去
Throwing a few people out of airlock

421
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,290
能让你感觉好受吗?
is gonna make you feel better about yourself?

422
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,170
请相信我  他们不是那些该被锁进减压舱的人
Because, believe me, those aren't the people that kept you locked in that room.

423
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,025
就是他们 并且不只是为了我 
They'll do. And not just for me, 

424
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:27,800
是为了所有留在那颗星球上的人
but for every person we left back on that planet,

425
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,260
因为必须有人要为此付出代价
because someone has got to pay.

426
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,720
你可以与我们一起干  或是别管我们
So you can either get with it or you can get lost.

427
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,060
那是你想要得吗  卡拉?  你想让我离开?
Is that what you want, Kara? You want me to leave?

428
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,470
山姆不想说他有罪
He doesn't want to say he's guilty,

429
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,480
是因为盖塔是一个不错的人 对吗  军士长?
because Gaeta is such a good guy. Right, Chief?

430
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,150
所有人都喜欢盖塔 那么就让他不要再被迷惑
Everyone likes Gaeta, so let's let him off the hook.

431
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,030
那让我们从其他方面看看这个人吧
Let's just look the other way on this one.

432
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,280
嗯  很多好人都为他们所做的付出了代价
Well, a lot of good people had to pay the price for what they did,

433
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,160
他们在新卡布里卡所做的决定 就像我的老婆
the choices they made on New Caprica. Like my wife.

434
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,540
那是对的 艾伦通了敌
That's right, Ellen collaborated.

435
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,290
把地下抵抗组织的信息透露给了赛昂人 她付出了生命的代价
Gave the Cylons information on the Resistance and she died for it.

436
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,050
因为那是叛国通敌的代价
Because that's the price of collaborating with the enemy.

437
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,680
相比盖塔  我更喜欢她
And I liked her a lot more than I like Gaeta.

438
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,600
听着  山姆
Look, Sam,

439
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,600
我现在处在不同的立场
I'm in a different place now.

440
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:29,530
我不知道该如何向你解释
I don't know how else to explain it to you,

441
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,440
但当我走出监狱  
but I got out of that cell,

442
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,700
那就像有人把世界染了另一种颜色
and it's like someone painted the world in different colors.

443
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,410
我现在看着你
And I look at you,

444
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,250
我都想把你的眼睛挖出来  只因为它在看着我
and I want to tear your eyes out just for looking at me.

445
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,590
我只想狠扁一个人  而那人最好是你
I just want to hurt someone and it might as well be you.

446
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,220
所以你该在那发生之前滚开
So you should probably go before that happens.

447
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,150
波塔尔签署的处决命令  组织行刑队
Baltar signed death warrants, organized murder squads.

448
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,570
是他从一开始就通敌叛国的
He collaborated with the enemy from day one.

449
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,900
是波塔尔  不是盖塔
Baltar, not Gaeta.

450
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,990
都是些同样可憎的东西
It's the same gods-damned thing!

451
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,490
他是对的
SEELIX: He's right.

452
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,450
很多人因他们而死的  军士长
A lot of people died because of them, Chief.

453
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,670
好吧  有罪
Fine. Guilty.

454
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,760
还记得这个吗? 
Remember this?

455
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,770
我不想再要它了
I don't want this anymore.

456
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,240
山姆
Sam.

457
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,450
带走他
SEELIX: Take him!

458
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,420
转过头来! 跪下! 跪下!
Turn around. On your knees. On your knees!

459
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,390
菲里克斯・盖塔
Felix Gaeta,

460
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,390
你已经被特别法庭审判并判决
you've been tried and found guilty of crimes against humanity

461
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,940
有反人类罪
by a circle of your peers

462
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,190
这是由联邦总统授权的特别法庭
as duly authorized by the President of the Colonies.

463
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:29,500
如果你有什么想要申辩的 就是现在了
If you have any words to offer in your own defense, now is the time.

464
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,710
拜托  菲里克斯  说啊 我们会听     
Come on, Felix, talk. We'll listen.

465
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,710
没错  就是那样
Yeah, that's right.

466
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,010
我们会听你说  你是如何隐藏在波塔尔身边
We'll listen to you tell us how hiding behind Baltar's skirt

467
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,510
那其实是你帮助反抗组织的办法
was actually your way of helping the insurgency.

468
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,140
快说
Say something.

469
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,350
说什么呢?
What's the point?

470
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,900
我已经尝试解释了
I already tried to explain it.

471
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,820
我不会乞求的
I'm not gonna beg.

472
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,240
太糟了  你四个月来都没有长进
Too bad you didn't grow that spine four months ago.

473
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,050
乞求
Beg.

474
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,760
乞求!
Beg.

475
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,300
乞求!        瑟瑞丝…
Beg! TIGH: Thrace...

476
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,430
不!      乞求
No. Beg.

477
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,350
拜托  菲里克斯  告诉他们  在整段时间里 
Come on, Felix, tell them how you were actually working

478
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,600
你是如何为抵抗组织工作的
for the Resistance the entire time!

479
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,020
说啊!
Come on!

480
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,110
告诉他们所有重要的信息是你传出来的
Tell them all about the important information that you were giving up.

481
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,860
告诉他们所有的信息和那个狗食盆
Tell them about all the messages, and the dog bowl and everything else.

482
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,990
还有其他的         什么?
Just tell me. What?

483
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,370
她说了什么?   她刚才说了什么?
What did she say? What did she just say?

484
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,450
一边儿去 
Back up!

485
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,450
她刚才说了什么?  你跟她说了什么?
What did she just say? What did you say to her?

486
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,160
告诉我  你跟她说了什么?
Tell me, what did you say to her?

487
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,330
那是一个黄色的狗食盆  
It was a yellow dog bowl.

488
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,750
那是一个信号 那代表着在垃圾堆的抽屉里有情报
It was a signal. It meant there was a message in the garbage dump.

489
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,010
是我转交的情报.那是一个信号
Turn it over, it was a signal.

490
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,090
意味着在垃圾堆的抽屉里有一个情报
It meant there was a message at the garbage dump.

491
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,800
噢  原来是你啊
Oh, that was you.

492
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,560
噢  我的天
Oh, my God...

493
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,560
你在干什么?  军士长
What are you doing? Chief...

494
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,320
那儿是有一个黄色的狗食盆 是我用到的
There was a yellow dog bowl. I used it.

495
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,030
你还问过谁会是情报源的呢  上校
But I never knew who the source was, Colonel.

496
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,660
他不可能从别处知道的
There's no other way he could have known.

497
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,740
只有他才有可能接触到那些信息
He's the only other one that would know about it.

498
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,830
就是他告诉我们处决名单
He's the reason we know about the death lists,

499
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,500
他是我能救得了凯莉的原因 他是我们现在在船上的原因
he's the reason I saved Cally, he's the reason we're on this ship.

500
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,670
就是他告诉我们内线消息的
He's the one who gave us the inside information.

501
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,720
他是我们的内线  上校
There's our source, Colonel.

502
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,890
我做了我能做到的
I did what I could.

503
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,690
我不知道我还能做些什么
I don't know what else I could've done.

504
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,380
这是什么该死的东西?
What the hell is this?

505
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,800
这是完全合法的
It's all perfectly legal.

506
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,100
你会在档案中找到总统的行政命令 授权一个…
You'll find a signed executive order on file authorizing a secret jury

507
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,810
由6人组成的秘密法庭  去调查  审判  和执行在
of six men and women to try, sentence and execute people guilty

508
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,690
战争期间有叛国通敌罪的人
of extraordinary crimes while collaborating with the enemy at a time of war.

509
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,690
同样有我签了名的死刑执行书
There's also a death warrant with my signature for every conviction.

510
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,900
你做总统真是个闹剧 从现在开始被终止了
Your presidency is a farce. It stops right now.

511
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,860
如果他们有罪  他们被相应的法庭审判
If they're guilty, they'll be tried by a jury of their peers.

512
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:54,790
他们有一个法庭 但他们没有律师
They have a jury, but they don't get lawyers.

513
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,160
他们不需要几周或者几个月去搞那个审判
They don't get to showboat for weeks and months on end.

514
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,580
他们也不会责备"体制的问题"
They don't get to blame the system.

515
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,500
并且他们也不会被当作烈士或是什么无辜的人
And they don't get lasting fame as martyrs or innocent people

516
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,340
只是在一个错误的地点和错误的时间
just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

517
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,090
让他们就此消失  就是现在!
They just disappear, now,

518
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,510
在占领与新时代来临之间的 
in the gray twilight between the long night of the occupation

519
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,510
漫长黑夜中的灰暗拂晓
and the dawn of a new era.

520
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,640
你可以走进一个干净的办公室 手上不用沾上他们的血
You come into office clean, without their blood on your hands.

521
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,520
很好  谢谢你  真像是诗歌一般
Well, thank you, that's very poetic.

522
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,860
但是你有个问题   总统先生
However, you have a problem, Mr. President.

523
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,400
法律赋予所有人在审判的时要有辩护律师
Everyone, by law, is entitled to a trial with representation. Everyone.

524
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:34,030
这是不能因总统的一时兴起就被违背的
It is not an option to be discarded at the President's whim.

525
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,950
你以为公开审判你就能够获得正义?
You think by making the trials public that you'll find justice?

526
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,290
是  我就这样想.
Yes, I do.

527
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,000
算了吧 劳拉 你不会那么天真吧
Come on, Laura. You're not that naive.

528
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,840
我告诉你如果把这些案子交给法庭会发生什么
Let me tell you what's going to happen if these cases go to trial.

529
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,670
那会让舰队浪费数月  甚至可能几年
It'll consume this fleet for months, maybe years.

530
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,430
人们会排队去作证告发他们的邻居
People will be lining up to testify against their neighbors.

531
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,970
这会像是马戏团…
It'll be a circus.

532
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,220
给乌合之众的表演
An entertainment for the mob

533
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,930
并且你会每年都签署死刑命令书
and you'll be signing death warrants almost every day.

534
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,560
那会是你下个任期想做的吗  劳拉?
Is that how you want to spend your next term, Laura,

535
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,360
做一个刽子手的头?
as executioner-in-chief?

536
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,950
"以我的生命"
PRIEST:... with every fiber of my being.

537
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,790
"以我的生命"
"... with every fiber of my being. "

538
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,370
祝贺你  总统女士
Congratulations, Madam President.

539
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,790
谢谢你
Thank you.

540
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,260
感谢大家再次信任我
Thank you all for once again entrusting me

541
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,930
从事此项高层行政工作
with this high office of civil service.

542
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,720
今天对我们来说是一个新的开始
Today is a new beginning for all of us.

543
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,140
我们同担共同的命运
We share a unique destiny,

544
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:44,440
我们要创造自己的未来 但我们也不该遗忘过去
but our future is ours to shape and our past cannot be forgotten.

545
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,940
新的一天需要新的想法
A new day requires new thinking.

546
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,440
同时我想值此机会
And while I had intended on using this occasion

547
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,870
向大家公布一个一个关于检举办公室调查的
as an opportunity to announce the formation of a special prosecutor's office

548
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,120
叛国通敌法案
charged with investigating acts of collaboration with the enemy,

549
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,380
我决定以不同的方式来替换它
I have decided instead that a different gesture is called for on this,

550
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,710
在我新任期的头一天 以总统的名义
the first day of my next term as your president.

551
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,670
我们都需要正义
We all feel the need for justice,

552
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,140
我们都想要报仇
and we all feel the need for vengeance,

553
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,970
把这两者区分 在现在是很难的
and telling the difference between the two can be difficult at times.

554
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,440
我们都是赛昂人的受害者 并且没有人能做到公正不阿
We are all victims of the Cylons and none of us can be impartial.

555
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,650
我确实不能
I certainly can't.

556
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:32,150
所以  今天我成立一个真相委员会
So today, I am forming a commission on truth and reconciliation,

557
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,410
完整地来听大家的故事 并记录流传给子孙后代
to hear our stories and record them for posterity.

558
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,450
这不存在任何的起诉
There will be no prosecutions.

559
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:46,920
我已经在这个舰队中向所有的人类 签发了大赦法案
I am issuing a general pardon for every human being in this fleet.

560
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,790
这在今天可能不会受到欢迎
This will not be a popular move today.

561
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:56,010
但是我相信这是唯一的方法
But I truly believe that this is the only way for us to move forward in strength

562
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,640
让大家在和解与恢复的精神下  奋力前行
in a spirit of healing and reconciliation.

563
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:06,850
我要谢谢大家不断的耐心和勇气
I thank you for your continued patience and courage.

564
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,650
日安!
Good day.

565
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,450
谢谢
Thank you.

566
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,760
嗨 军士长 要坐吗
Hey, Chief, want a seat?
