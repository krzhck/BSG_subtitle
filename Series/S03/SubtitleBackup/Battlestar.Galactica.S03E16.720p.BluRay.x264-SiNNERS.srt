1
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,020
太空堡垒卡拉狄加 【 前情提要 】
TYROL: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,770
作为殖民地公民
I demand my rights as a Colonial citizen

3
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,270
我有权要求法律代表出庭 以及完整的法定诉讼程序
to legal representation and full due process.

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
是吗?
Do you?

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,030
那下一步怎么办?
So what happens next?

6
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,030
让他得到公正审判
We give him his trial.

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,280
家父曾是一名牧师 家母曾是一名先知
My father was a priest. My mother was an oracle.

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,870
我从18岁就在太空堡垒上服役
I've served a Battlestar since I was 18 years old.

9
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,370
当你们选我作工会主席的时候 我保证过会让大家有活干
When you elected me union president, I promised I would keep us working.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,830
你们自己必须亲自爬在齿轮  杠杆... 
You must throw your body on the gears and on the levers

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,170
机器上来阻止它们运转
and on the machine itself and make it stop!

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,090
罢工  罢工  罢工
ALL: Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,720
你还在装作我们的生活从未改变
You're pretending like nothing's changed,

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,140
和在新卡布里卡之前一样吗?
that our lives are exactly like they were before we went to New Caprica.

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,390
可的确已经不同了
But it is different.

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,720
恩  我们只是一时的困境罢了
Yeah, I was just going through a little rough patch.

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,020
如果是一世呢?
What if rough patches are all we have left?

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,740
菲戈斯基  波吕克斯 桑切斯
TYROL: Figurski, Pollux, Sanchez,

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,240
你们今晚修理所有轻便引擎 所以推掉所有夜生活吧
you're gonna be rehabbing mule engines tonight so don't make after-dinner plans.

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,200
把系统下线检测开关设为软件控制
Set and hold SOL check rigged to SEC.

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,080
我们不是让道格维尔的平民来替我们进行轻便引擎的维修么
 I thought we were subbing out mule maintenance to the civvies in Dogsville?

22
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,830
对  可那里的技工不够
Yeah, we don't got enough mechanics down there.

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,590
检查流量
Check flow rate.

24
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,920
流量稳定在2-9-0
POLLUX: Flow rate steady at 290.

25
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,390
什么时候能有休息时间啊  轮机长?
Hey, when are we getting some rack around here, Chief?

26
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,010
我已经连续两周站两班了
I'm standing double watches the last two weeks.

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,100
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

28
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,680
还有我的耳朵里还一直嗡嗡响
Plus, I still got the ringing in my ears.

29
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,270
耳朵里嗡嗡响!
MAN:The ringing in the ears!

30
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,850
对不起 我听不到你说什么 我耳朵里嗡嗡响 你说什么?
TYROL: I'm sorry, I can't hear you. I've got ringing. What's that?

31
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,400
伙计们 有意思
POLLUX: Real funny, guys.

32
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,940
燃料指示器坏了
Hey, fuse indicators are out.

33
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,860
机翼油箱开关设为"满油"  关机      好  停止加油 
Set the wing tank switch to fuel. Power off. All right, tank off.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,280
关闭燃料站
That's it. Kill the fueling stations.

35
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,240
拔出输油管   中尉  油已加满 可以起飞了
Pull the hose. Lt., you're tanked up and ready to roll.

36
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,540
收到  轮机长 准备起飞
Roger that, Chief. Ready to roll.

37
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,840
洗好的衣服到了 菲戈斯基 波吕克斯 莱夫
Laundry call, Figurski, Pollux, Redford.

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,300
快拿走你们的破烂 免得我塞到搅拌机里
Grab your crap before I chuck it in the cycler.

39
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,720
把内衣叠成我喜欢的样式了吗?
Fold my undies the way I like?

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,810
滚   嘴好刁哇 
Frak off. Oh, nice mouth.

41
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,350
你说他们就让军官这样说话吗?
You think they let officers talk like that?

42
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,140
拿勋章的时候  可要把你的态度改一下
You're gonna have to change your ways when you get them wings.

43
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,270
拿不到勋章了
I'm not getting wings.

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,520
他们拒绝了我的飞行训练申请
They rejected my application for flight training.

45
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,280
但你在笔试中却拿了第一  面试不错吧?
I thought you aced the written exam. Interview went well?

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,570
恩  结果是我处于重要位置 我的离开将导致
Yeah, well, it turns out I'm in a critical position and my leaving would cause

47
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,580
严重任务退步
severe mission degradation.

48
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,250
真逊   "重要位置"个屁
That sucks. Critical position, my ass.

49
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,580
他们只是不愿意让乡巴佬坐进驾驶员的预备室
They just don't want knuckle-draggers stinking up the pilot ready room.

50
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,840
好了  够了 都闭嘴吧
All right, that's enough. Lock it up! That's enough.

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,170
空军队长告诉我  你从飞行训练落榜了
Look, the CAG told me you got bounced from flight training.

52
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,130
我很遗憾  这事不好受
I'm sorry about that. It sucks.

53
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,340
实话说 我们需要你  你是我们最好的航空设备技工
The truth is we need you down here, you're the best avionics specialist we got.

54
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,590
她还知道怎么来叠 老爷们的内衣
And she knows how to fold a man's undies.

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,220
嗨 哇 哇 你他妈…
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You frak...

56
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,810
嗨 拜托 够了
Hey, come on! Hey, whoa! That's enough!

57
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,850
够了  别打了 你疯了?   我废了你
Enough! Get off! What, are you crazy? I'll take you apart!

58
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,430
少说两句  菲戈斯基
Hey! Shut up, Figurski!

59
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,270
看我不收拾你  快回去工作
I'll pop you in the mouth myself. Now get back to work.

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,940
过来  过来
Come here! Come here!

61
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,650
松手 听我说
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.

62
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,610
你在这里的工作和坐在驾驶舱里同等重要
Look, you do important work down here, just as important as sitting in a cockpit.

63
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,450
谢谢  轮机长
Thanks, Chief.

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,290
我要去派送一些重要的洗好的衣物了
I'm gonna deliver some more important laundry.

65
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,610
猛禽机升空了 读数正常
Raptor away. Readings nominal.

66
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,370
看来一切都不错  设置航线 飞向2-9-6-5-
Everything looks good. Setting course heading 2965...

67
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,870
怎么他妈回事?
What the frak?

68
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,410
熄火了  RCS推进器卡住了 (译注:RCS=反推力控制系统)
It's a flameout! RCS thrusters jammed!

69
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,500
重启 无效
Restart! No go!

70
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,340
卡拉狄加  我是斯卡司 二号引擎推进器完全堵塞
Galactica, Skulls. We have an engine thruster stuck in full position!

71
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,510
一号引擎无法启动
Engine one won't start!

72
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,800
二号引擎着火  快爆炸了 到这里来
There's a fire in engine two! It's gonna blow! Get your ass up here!

73
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,490
弹射  弹射  弹射
Eject! Eject! Eject!

74
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,500
我们走运  一打人受伤  无人遇难
You got off lucky. A dozen injuries. No fatalities.

75
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,170
谢谢
Thank you.

76
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,815
你应该检查一下托莉的肩膀 
You should've seen Tory's shoulder. 

77
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:45,380
我都得帮科特尔医生把它复原
I had to help Cottle put it back into alignment.

78
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,930
我一直很忙  几乎没机会到船的这端走走
You know, I am so busy, I hardly ever make it down to this end of the ship.

79
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,180
在舱壁修好前 
And now I'm gonna be living here for God knows how long

80
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,850
我还要一直住这里
until they repair the bulkheads.

81
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,190
如果这里的房间太挤 我的另一张床永远欢迎你
If the quarters become cramped, you're always welcome in one of my beds.

82
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,900
一种说话方式而已
In a manner of speaking.

83
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,570
查清猛禽号出什么事了吗?
Do you have any better idea what happened to your Raptor?

84
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,820
还在调查情况
We're still investigating the situation.

85
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,450
不过看来是泰里恩受到了严重的杂质污染
But it seems that the tylium was seriously contaminated with impurities.

86
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,080
很可能是精炼过程中出现的问题
Most likely, it's a problem with the refining process.

87
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,370
那里到底怎么回事?
What the hell's going on there?

88
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,880
精炼船曾是舰队里最可靠的船只
The refinery used to be the most reliable ship in the fleet.

89
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,260
而现在我每天都能收到那边工头发来一堆的信息
Now every day I start with a stack of messages from that chief.

90
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,170
他叫什么名字?  吉诺・范纳
What is his name? Zeno Fenner.

91
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,220
范纳?    抱怨工作条件和交货时间
Fenner, complaining about working conditions and deliveries,

92
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,890
还有备件和补助  你能相信么
and spare parts and compensation, if you can believe that.

93
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:43,440
我们在逃命 这家伙却想着加班奖金
We're on the run for our lives and the guy wants to talk about overtime bonuses.

94
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,230
我们对范纳以及他的生产问题已经够宽容了
We've been more than patient with Fenner and his production problems.

95
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,360
给了他两周时间 让他重新投入工作
Two weeks of sitting here, waiting for him to get his act together.

96
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,830
我不知道你怎么想的 但我准备好去找地球了
I don't know about you, but I'm ready to get back on the road to finding Earth.

97
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,790
我看到的是希望的曙光吗?
Is that a hint of hope I hear?

98
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,170
怀疑主义者最后还是决定去寻找地球了?
Is the skeptic suddenly decided that we're on the road to Earth, after all?

99
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,130
我怀疑过吗?
Have I ever doubted it?

100
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,640
我手下的人六个月以来连续工作18个小时才换班
I've got people working 18 hour shifts for the past six months.

101
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,640
你们说一个人这样下去能坚持多久?
How long do you think a man can keep that up?

102
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:26,150
如果赛昂人出现了 我们的燃料足够让全舰队跳跃一次么?
If the Cylons show up, we have enough fuel to jump the entire fleet, what, once?

103
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,030
也许两次
Maybe twice?

104
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,030
这留给我可选择的空间太小了
That's a margin that's much too narrow for me.

105
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,570
对于你和你的手下呢?
How about for you and your men?

106
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,490
你有异议 自己想办法解决
You have a problem. Fix it.

107
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,710
继续生产燃料 其他事我们稍后再谈 我保证
Just get the gas flowing. And then we'll talk, I promise you that.

108
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,750
"再谈"?  总是稍后
Then we'll talk. It's always later.

109
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,170
有意思的是燃料生产了 
You know, it's funny that when the gas flows,

110
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,220
我的电话却没回音
my phone calls don't get returned.

111
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,640
可一旦燃料供给中出现了小差错
But the minute there's a glitch in the fuel supply, I've got face time with

112
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,970
我就能和总统 上将见面了
the President and the Admiral.

113
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,390
嗯
Hmm...

114
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,890
也许我们还应该再有些小差错
Maybe we should just start having more glitches.

115
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,560
这算是威胁么?
Is that a threat?

116
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,400
正如那本书中所写到的一样...
It's like the book says.

117
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,820
"听取民声就不会惧怕民众"
"If you hear the people, you'll never have to fear the people. "

118
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,440
你是说"那本书"吗?
Did you say the book?

119
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,570
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

120
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,410
守卫 以在战时勒索及干扰重要服务…
Guards, arrest him for extortion and interrupting vital services

121
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,830
拘捕他
during a time of war.

122
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,870
来吧 把他带走  就这样  去吧 把他带出去
Go ahead, take him away. That's it. Go. Out of here. Gone.

123
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,580
跟我来  先生
Come with me, sir.

124
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
这又是哪一出戏?
What the hell was that?

125
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,420
他在引用波塔尔书中的原话
He was quoting from Baltar's book.

126
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,840
他的律师从禁闭室里带出的那些乱七八糟的东西?
The ramblings that his lawyer smuggled out of the brig?

127
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,350
他让人重印后在舰队里分发
He's having it reprinted and passed out among the Fleet

128
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,270
还把书名定为《我的成与败》 盖尤斯・波塔尔著
and he's calling it My Triumphs, My Mistakes, by Gaius Baltar.

129
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,150
我在考虑来一场老套的焚书运动
I am thinking of having a good old-fashioned book-burning.

130
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,480
肉糕好吃吗? 开始喜欢吃肉糕了
Ooh, algae meatloaf, starting to be a favorite.

131
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,950
那不是给你吃的 还记得我们的谈话吗?
It's not for you. Remember our little talk?

132
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,660
今天是我的"作弊日" (译注:节食过程中  一周内唯一可以大吃大喝的日子)
Oh, but today's my cheat day.

133
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,290
前三天都是你的"作弊日"
The last three days have been your cheat day.

134
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,620
是吗?
Really?

135
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,170
你昨天移动更灵活的
You were moving better yesterday.

136
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,550
屈身运动就这点用处?
Is that how the bends are supposed to work?

137
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,720
我只是替希里克斯难过 所以有点紧张
I'm just upset about Seelix, so I'm tensing up.

138
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,720
他们早就该告诉她舰队里的首要任务是什么
They should've just told her right off the bat what the fleet priorities are.

139
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,640
应该告诉她 比起驾驶员来
Should've said that they needed knuckle-draggers

140
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,230
他们更需要工人
more than they need pilots.

141
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,310
这不是"舰队首要任务"的问题
It isn't about fleet priorities.

142
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,860
我们不是统治阶级 所以只能干脏活
We're not part of the ruling class, so we're stuck doing the dirty work.

143
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,940
"统治阶级"  这词你从哪听到的?
The ruling class? Where'd you get that?

144
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,650
我读的书上 波塔尔写的书
Something I read, by Baltar.

145
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,450
这些破书还在舰队里传开了
Those frakking rags making their way around the fleet?

146
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,580
没想到还会有人去看那家伙写的东西
I can't believe that anybody's reading anything written by that guy.

147
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,750
我原本也是那么想的 可是…
That's what I thought too, but...

148
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,250
你是否想过为何所有驾驶员和军官都来自富有的殖民地?
You ever wonder why all the pilots and the officers come from the rich Colonies,

149
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,420
像是卡布里卡  沃钢 或是特诺朗
like Caprica, and Virgon, Tauron?

150
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,430
而所有工人都来自贫穷的殖民地
Well, all the knuckle-draggers come from the poor Colonies,

151
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,680
像是爱诺朗  撒纪特恩  还有杰米纳
like Aerelon and Sagitarron and Gemenon.

152
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,970
甲板手扯蛋而已
Yeah, that's just trash talk on the deck.

153
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,270
是吗?  在舰队里挑出一个来自贫穷殖民地的军官
Really? Name one officer on the Fleet that comes from a poor Colony.

154
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,020
杜亚拉  杜亚拉中尉来自撒纪特恩
Dualla, Lieutenant Dualla's from Sagitarron.

155
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,860
这就是例子  她怎么升职的?
Case in point. How did she get promoted?

156
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,780
她嫁给了一位来自卡布里卡的军官
She married an officer from Caprica.

157
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,580
我是蒂罗尔
Tyrol.

158
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,370
轮机长 燃料精炼厂的工头已经被逮捕了
ADAMA: Chief, the foreman at the fuel refinery's just been arrested.

159
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,130
吉诺・范纳?   你认识他?
Zeno Fenner? Do you know him?

160
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,960
吉诺出了什么事吗?
Did something happen to Zeno?

161
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,880
被捕了   是的 长官   在新卡布里卡上的时候 他曾是工会中的一员
Arrested. Yes, sir. He was in the union on New Caprica.

162
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,470
他看起来人不错  犯了什么事?
He seemed like a good guy. What'd he do?

163
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,550
他惹总统生气了
He pissed off the President.

164
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,560
不过当前更大的问题是精炼厂的生产任务
But the bigger problem right now is the refining operation.

165
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,730
必须有人去那里 让燃料船投入工作
I need someone to go over there and get that fuel ship moving again.

166
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,150
组成一支小组  带上装备一小时内到达机库
Pick a team, get your gear and be on the hangar deck in an hour.

167
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,520
是  长官
Yes, sir.

168
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,820
我不明白 吉诺出了什么事?
I don't understand. What happened to Zeno?

169
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,530
把总统惹了
He pissed off the President.

170
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,580
现在因为这事都会被捕了?
You mean, you can get arrested for that now?

171
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
我看上将是在开玩笑
I think the Admiral was kidding.

172
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,160
是啊
Yeah.

173
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,170
你想起过工会吗?
You ever think about the union?

174
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,290
当然 但那已经一去不复返了
Sure, but that's gone now.

175
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,050
新卡布里卡已经一去不复返了 但工会里所有的人还在这里
New Caprica's gone, but all the people in the union are still here.

176
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,760
唯一的差别就是 现在没人为他们出头
The only difference is now they don't have anyone to stand up for them.

177
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,640
我得走了
I gotta go.

178
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,680
希望你们能尽兴
I do hope you're enjoying yourselves.

179
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,850
打扰了我的休息 弄脏了我的食物还不够
It's not enough that you have to interrupt my sleep and put filth in my food.

180
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,860
现在还来毁坏我的用品 你们真是无理取闹
Now you have to destroy my stuff as well. You're pathetic!

181
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,070
你们完全根本--
You're utterly and totally...

182
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,110
你好啊  博士
Hello, Doctor.

183
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,530
识相点
Why don't you do yourself a favor?

184
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,660
把书页交出来  就此罢手吧
Hand over the pages and stop all this nonsense.

185
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,250
我不知道你是什么意思
I don't know what you're talking about.

186
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,960
把他转过来
Turn him around.

187
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,810
你写的书的书页 《我的成与败》盖尤斯・波塔尔所著
The pages to your book, My Triumphs, My Mistakes by Gaius Baltar.

188
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,600
你读过了?
So, you've read it.

189
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,890
民众读了这本书 你感到惭愧了
The people are reading it and now you're sorry.

190
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,480
我们知道你的律师把书页悄悄携带出去已有几周时间了
We've known that your lawyer was smuggling the pages out of here for weeks.

191
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,730
所以全被我们截获了 恐怕只有我拜读了大作 
So, we intercepted them and I'm afraid I'm the only one who's read the book,

192
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,200
所以我很想知道它的结局
and I am dying to see how it ends.

193
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,990
你现在真的把自己当作平民出身的人?
Really, what were you thinking now, casting yourself as a man of the people,

194
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,500
一个农民的儿子?  一个革命份子?
the son of a farmer, a revolutionary?

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,330
可得了吧
Oh, please.

196
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,210
说出来你也许会惊讶 总统阁下
It may come as some surprise to you, Madam President,

197
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,170
但我希望以普通人的身份来打动法庭
but I wish to strike a chord with the common man.

198
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,300
把书页交出来  不然我就让这些守卫搜你的身
Hand over those pages or I'll have these guards search you.

199
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,930
你自己选择
Make a choice.

200
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,390
各位  继续
Gentlemen, proceed.

201
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,210
别向她屈服  盖尤斯
Don't bend to her, Gaius.

202
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,590
让她知道  她无法让你动摇
Show her that she can't break you.

203
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,420
保持你的尊严
Keep your dignity.

204
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,060
可能你会考虑一下在封底写个简评
Perhaps you'd consider writing a blurb for the back cover.

205
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
谢谢  博士
Thank you, Doctor.

206
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,410
关上牢门
GUARD: Close cell.

207
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,010
没事  盖尤斯  一切都会没事的
It's all right, Gaius. Everything will be okay.

208
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,020
蒂罗尔
Tyrol!

209
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,610
凯伯 嗨
Cabott! Hey.

210
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,320
还好吗
How you doing?

211
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,110
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.

212
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,120
抱歉      没关系 难免的事
Sorry. Never mind. It's inevitable.

213
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,910
哥们  我不得不说...
Listen, I gotta tell ya,

214
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,160
知道他们要派你来的时候  我们就觉得好多了
we all started feeling a lot better when we heard they were sending you.

215
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,750
是吗?      那是
Oh, yeah? You bet.

216
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,460
我一直在说你的好话
I've been talking you up,

217
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,170
说新卡布里卡上工会...
telling everybody how the union on New Caprica

218
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,750
是如何为小人物出头的
really stood up for the little guy.

219
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,090
恩
Yeah, well...

220
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,890
你看到的就是整个舰队的泰里恩了
You're looking at the Fleet's entire fuel supply of tylium.

221
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,720
我们还能跳跃多少次?
How many jumps you think we got?

222
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,520
能跳出这个星系就算走运了
We'll be lucky if we get out of the system.

223
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,150
你最好带我四处看一下 看一下我们目前的情况
Well, you'd better give us the nickel tour, see where we stand.

224
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,440
大场面
This is a big operation.

225
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,690
等这地方全部运转起来后 你再看看这里
Yeah, well, you should see this place when it's up and running.

226
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,690
比炸弹还响 就比它安全一些
Loud as an A-bomb and just about as safe.

227
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,710
我们真的需要一些休息时间 看看周围
Listen, we really need this downtime. I mean, look around.

228
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,750
下次机器出现故障  可能就不只废了一架猛禽机了
Next time some machine fraks up, it might not just take out a Raptor.

229
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,590
这艘船真是一颗随时可能爆炸的炸弹
This ship really is a big bomb just waiting to go up.

230
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,800
我知道有风险  但我必须要让这里开始工作
Yeah, look, I understand the risk, but I need to see it working,

231
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,100
所以把你的人都叫上  开始工作吧
so pull your guys off, and let's fire it up.

232
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,140
这么做没用
It ain't gonna work.

233
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,310
你在这里上班?
You work here?

234
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,400
这位是麦洛 我最好的润滑手
This is Milo. He's the best grease jockey I got.

235
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,400
麦洛是吧?  告诉我   麦洛  为什么行不通?
Milo, huh? Hey, Milo, so why is it not gonna work?

236
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,530
有什么事没告诉我?  说吧
Something you guys aren't telling me? Come on.

237
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,540
好吧 看来我得自己看看了
Okay. I guess I'm just gonna have to have a look for myself.

238
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,920
那是卸压阀么?
Is that pressure relief?

239
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,260
密封环不见了?
The seals are missing.

240
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,340
都不见了
They all are.

241
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,140
没有压力密封环  机器运转不了
Without pressure seals, the machinery won't run.

242
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,560
到哪去了?
Well, where are they?

243
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,720
看来是丢了
Guess they got lost, huh?

244
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,020
伙计们  你们不能拿这开玩笑
Guys, you can't be frakking around with this stuff.

245
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,600
上将不会容忍这种行为   让上将见鬼去吧
The Admiral won't stand for it. The Admiral can kiss my ass.

246
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,110
嗨 嗨!
Hey, hey!

247
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,610
拜托  轮机长 你也知道这是为什么
Come on, Chief, you know what this is about.

248
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,490
我想工作环境如果有所改善 
I guess when working conditions improve

249
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:18,320
再把吉诺放出来的话  我们就能找到那些密封环了
and they let Zeno out of jail, we'll be able to find those seals.

250
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,700
在此之前 这艘船
Until then, it looks like this ship

251
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,830
不会炼出一粒泰里恩
isn't going to be refining another drop of tylium.

252
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,370
就是说这支舰队哪都去不了
And that means this Fleet isn't going anywhere.

253
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,880
我已经搜遍了整艘船  还是没有找到密封环
I've executed a search of the ship, but the seals have not turned up.

254
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,720
你也知道  这是蓄意破坏
You know that this is sabotage.

255
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,300
我要把他们关起来
I'm inclined to have them locked up.

256
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,720
长官  求你  他们可以安装一些东西来暗害我
Sir, please, they could've rigged something to have me injured.

257
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,010
他们可以故意污染燃料
They could have contaminated the fuel on purpose

258
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,180
让我们所有的船爆炸
and left all of our ships dead in the air.

259
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,390
我的天
Good Gods.

260
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,060
而他们所做的就是为了争取一些时间
All they did do was buy themselves some time.

261
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,900
机器确实需要大修 
The machinery does need overhauling.

262
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,650
质量控制办事不力是有原因的
There's a reason that the quality control is failing.

263
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,150
你要知道那艘船上大部分工人...
Do you realize that most of the workers on that ship

264
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,870
自从殖民地遇袭后 一天也没休息过
have not had a day off since the original attack on the Colonies?

265
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,080
像是在做苦役一样
It's like slave labor.

266
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,660
别乱说了
Don't be absurd.

267
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,160
那艘船上的人被困在了那里
The men and women aboard that ship are stuck there.

268
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,750
无法脱身  无法调职 
They can't leave, they can't transfer.

269
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,420
无法掌握自己的命运
They have no control over their lives.

270
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,340
并且工作繁重 这我们知道
And the work is hard, we know that.

271
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,130
他们是以为自己在海藻加工厂...
Do they think they're having a picnic on the algae processing plant

272
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,340
或是军火库  废物处理厂吃野餐吗?
or munitions or waste processing?

273
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,640
舰队里的飞船都载满了在恶劣环境下工作的人
The fleet is filled with ships with people working under horrific conditions

274
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,600
并没有人在安心享乐
and nobody's having a good time.

275
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,100
我认为  如果我们能至少放了吉诺
Well, I think that if we at least release Zeno and start talking to them

276
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,520
然后和他们谈一些有关改善工作与居住环境的问题
about improving working conditions and living conditions,

277
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,730
抗议就会停止 他们就会归还压力密封环 
that the protest will go away, they'll return the pressure seals

278
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,780
我们也就能控制燃料污染问题
and we'll get the fuel contamination problem under control.

279
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,360
这种勒索的抗议方法是不可接受的
Extortion is not an acceptable method of protest.

280
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,570
带头人叫什么名字?
What are the names of the leaders?

281
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,710
只有凯伯   我会下达对他的逮捕令
Just Cabott. I will issue a warrant for his arrest.

282
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,370
把他关禁闭  震慑一下他
Put him in the brig, let him sweat it out.

283
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,880
上将  总统阁下  他们只是想..
Admiral, Madam President, they're just trying to...

284
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,010
轮机长  打住  话说完了
Chief, uh-uh. We're done.

285
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,860
我要去看一下凯伯和吉诺
I'm gonna go check on Cabott and Zeno.

286
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,170
轮机长
Chief?

287
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,670
嗨 嗨
Hey. Hey.

288
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,720
你得把他弄出去
You gotta get him out of here.

289
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,140
他的手怎么了?
What the hell happened to his hands?

290
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,560
他半夜起来抓墙
I wake up in the middle of the night, he's scratching the walls.

291
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,810
抓个没完 直到手指出血
He just keeps scratching them until his fingers are bleeding.

292
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,940
我不说  我不在乎 
I won't say, it don't matter...

293
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,690
他在新卡布里卡上的时候 就被赛昂人拘留过 记得吗?
He was in Cylon detention on New Caprica, you remember?

294
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,110
他出来以后就怪里怪气的 这么做对他有害无益
He came out all squirrelly, and this is not helping.

295
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,740
拜托 你得把他弄出去
Come on, you've got to get him out of here.

296
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,910
我不会说的
I won't say...

297
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,620
密封环在哪里?
Where are the seals?

298
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,330
你个狗杂种 说吧
You son of a bitch. Come on!

299
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,380
拜托  加伦 你得把他弄出去
Come on, Galen! You've got to get him out of here!

300
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,090
凯伯!      不  我不说
Cabott? I won't say. No, I won't...

301
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,130
凯伯  看着我
Cabott, look at me.

302
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,470
凯伯  听我说 密封环在哪里?
Cabott, listen to me. Where are the seals?

303
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,390
我不说  我不在乎 不在乎
I won't say. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

304
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,260
凯伯  我能救你出来  密封环在哪里?
Cabott, I can get you out of here. Where are the seals?

305
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,640
告诉我在哪里?      密封环在哪里?
Tell me where the seals are. I won't say. It doesn't matter...

306
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,980
老天啊  救他出去      我不在乎 我不在乎
For Gods sakes, get him out of here! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!

307
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,520
密封环在哪里?  在哪里?
Where are the seals? Where are they?

308
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,030
我不在乎  我不在乎       密封环在哪里?
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter! Where are the seals?

309
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,320
我不在乎  我不在乎       在哪里?
It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter! Where are they?

310
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,740
通风口
The air vent!

311
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,410
行了吧?  在船尾中间的通风口里
All right? They're in the center stern air vent!

312
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,660
告诉总统放了他们
Tell the President to release them.

313
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,100
好 这是最后一个
All right, that's the last one.

314
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,230
点火 回去工作
Let's fire this up, get back to work.

315
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,690
是  长官      一切听从你的吩咐  老大
Yes, sir. Whatever you say, boss.

316
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,530
嗨 嗨    可以让我来开闸吗?
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Can I throw the switch?

317
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,790
你多大?      12岁
How old are you? Twelve.

318
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,120
快12岁了
Almost.

319
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,580
可所有的机器  我都会操作
But I can run every machine we got.

320
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,040
唯一没做过的事  就是开闸
Only thing I haven't done is turn the whole thing on.

321
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,420
归你了
It's all yours.

322
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,060
那下面全是一些孩子  总统阁下 
TYROL: There are kids down there, Madam President.

323
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,430
舰队里的每艘船上都有小孩
There's children on every ship in the fleet.

324
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,150
这些孩子在精炼厂工作
These children work in the refinery.

325
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,360
他们只有12岁  15岁
They're 12, 15 years old.

326
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,030
自从有精炼厂的那一天开始 就有家庭住在那里
There have been families aboard the refinery ever since its beginning,

327
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,780
其他人则是在赛昂 袭击殖民地后被接上船的
and others were picked up after the Cylons attacked the Colonies.

328
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,160
在过去的两年中
Over the past two years,

329
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,410
家长一直在教授儿女如何操作机器
the parents have been teaching the children how to operate the machinery.

330
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,330
他们在把自己的技能传给下一代  这是很正常的事
They have been passing along their skills. It is perfectly normal.

331
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,460
这么做并不理想 我也知道
It is not ideal, I know that.

332
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,840
但这支舰队本身就没有什么理想之处
But there is nothing ideal about this Fleet.

333
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,050
您看出来这是怎么回事了么?
Do you see what's happening?

334
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,130
工作开始代代相传  总统阁下
Jobs are starting to be inherited, Madam President.

335
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,300
我们并不知道还要在这船上呆多久 如果是十年呢?
We don't know how long we're gonna be on these ships. What if it's 10 years?

336
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,020
就因为我是甲板手  我就非要把我的儿子训练成甲板手?
So, I train my son to be a deck hand because that's what I am?

337
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,310
就因为他只是这块料?
And that's all he can ever be?

338
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,810
这是我们想要的未来吗?
Is that the future we want?

339
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,240
你说得很对
That's a really good point.

340
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,620
托莉  制作一份名单  列出舰队里 
Tory, I want you to make a list of everyone in the Fleet

341
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,370
所有适合从事精炼工作的人
who has a work history appropriate to the refinery.

342
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,080
工厂工人   技工  所有你能想到的工种
Factory workers, mechanics, whatever you think.

343
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,290
然后交给轮机长 你来主持公开抽签
Give it to the Chief and I want you to hold a public lottery.

344
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,500
我们从其他船上找人 
And we will take people from other vessels

345
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,800
让他们与精炼厂的工人轮班
and we'll put them on shifts in the refinery.

346
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,300
怎么样  轮机长?
How's that, Chief?

347
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,260
谢谢您   谢谢你
Thank you. Thank you.

348
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,270
那些就是从道格维尔分配来的人?
TYROL: So that's our allotment from Dogsville.

349
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,310
在他们知道要去哪之前 
We'll get these people on these ships and out of here

350
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,440
就把他们带上船  离开这里
before they know where they're going.

351
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,520
好了  各位  我们排两行      打扰一下  先生
All right, people! Let's form two lines! Excuse me, sir!

352
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,400
一排这边 一排那边…
One down here, one over here...

353
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,440
我不知道应该找谁谈这件事
Hi, I don't really know who I'm supposed to talk to about this,

354
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,660
可我想我不是你们要找的人
but I don't really think I'm what you guys are looking for.

355
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,700
我没有这项技能
I don't really have the skills.

356
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,240
你叫什么名字?  丹尼・努
What's your name? Danny Noon.

357
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,040
菲戈斯基?    努?
Figurski? Noon.

358
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,540
努 努 努 丹尼 这上面写着你是农民
Noon. Noon. Noon, Daniel. Says you're a farmer.

359
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,210
农民?  这正是我们要找的人
Farmer? Yeah, that's what we're looking for.

360
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,130
可以操作重型机器的人    不 可我不会 
People to work with heavy machinery. No, but I don't.

361
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,300
不太会
Not really.

362
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,340
我为了攒钱上大学  一夏天都曾在一座农场打工
I worked on a farm for a summer because I was saving up to go to college.

363
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,050
专业是建筑学 接着就遭遇了赛昂人的袭击
Architecture, but then the Cylons attacked,

364
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,390
而我现在就成了农民  这怎么合理?
and now I'm a farmer? How is that fair?

365
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,850
从哪一点看是合理的?
How is that in any way fair?

366
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,810
失陪一下
Just give me a second.

367
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,610
如果为他开绿灯  其他人就会跟风而至
We make an exception for this guy, there's gonna be 15 more right behind him.

368
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,860
看看他  还是个孩子
Look at him, though. He's a kid.

369
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,410
好吧  把他带上船
Fine. Put him on the ship.

370
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,990
这只是暂时的  好吗?
Look, this is just a temporary thing, okay?

371
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,410
等一下  我不是农民
Hey, wait, hold on. I'm not a farmer!

372
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,540
这不是固定工作
Yeah, it's not permanent.

373
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,540
等一下 你能看一下我的档案吗?      好
No, wait, can you just check my record? Yeah.

374
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,920
请问 我该找谁谈这件事?
Excuse me. Who am I supposed to talk to about this?

375
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,670
我该找谁谈这件事?
Who am I supposed to talk to about this?

376
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,880
你怎么不明白 我不是农民
You don't understand! I'm not a farmer!

377
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,590
住手  我不是农民
Hey! Stop it! I'm not a farmer!

378
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,540
你来这里干什么?
What are you doing here?

379
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,340
你的书 是真实的还是虚构的?
Your book, fact or fiction?

380
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,380
你读过了?
So you read it?

381
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,550
这也就证明了总统是个十足的骗子
Well, that proves that the President is an accomplished liar.

382
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,720
她告诉我那本书还没上市 有什么感想?
She told me it hadn't gone out. So what do you make of it?

383
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,230
我看是一派胡言
I think that it's a pile of crap.

384
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,690
显然  我对两极分化社会所作的分析让你害怕了
Obviously, my analysis of a bifurcated society scares you.

385
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,690
不过在我书中所叙述的每件事恰恰都是事实
But everything in my book happens to be true.

386
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:19,910
是真的？ 你真的是一个从爱诺朗来的农村孩子？
Oh, it's true? It's true that you're a farm boy from Aerelon.

387
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,240
对  确实是这样
Yes, it is, as a matter of fact.

388
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,620
我确实生长在爱诺朗上
I was born and raised on a dairy outside the town

389
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,620
科菲波里沃镇外的一座牛奶厂
of Cuttlesbreath Wash on Aerelon.

390
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,630
我怎么就想象不出你在挤牛奶 
Why do I have such a hard time picturing you

391
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,800
施肥时会是什么样呢?
milking cows and shoveling manure?

392
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,460
缺乏想象力
Lack of imagination.

393
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,510
不然就是你的小故事本身就是谎话
Or maybe that your little tale is manure.

394
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,980
我认识从爱诺朗来的人 你听起来和他们不一样
I've known people from Aerelon. You don't sound anything like them.

395
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,770
我听起来不像是从爱诺朗来的?      不像
I don't sound like I'm from Aerelon? No.

396
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,770
我把这句话当作是你对我的褒奖
Well, you know I take that as a particular compliment.

397
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,690
我不知道你有什么感觉  可我认为爱诺朗方言 
I don't know about you, but I've always found the Aerelon dialect

398
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,280
向来都是对耳朵的一种折磨
to be particularly hard on the ears.

399
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,660
主要是那些
Something about the consonants

400
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,950
从喉咙后部发出的辅音
that scrape the back of the throat.

401
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,450
当然  我应该非常熟悉自己的口音
Of course, I should know an awful lot about my native tongue.

402
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,330
我曾连续用几小时来纠正它
I spent hours on end trying to overcome it.

403
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,250
你知道对于一个10岁的男孩来说 
Do you have any idea how hard it is

404
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,840
要改变他的说话方式有多难?
for a 10-year-old boy to change the way he speaks?

405
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,550
要把他所学到的一切东西都忘掉
To unlearn everything he ever learned

406
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,590
这样有一天 有一天 可能会有一丁点希望
so that one day there might be the small hope

407
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:28,020
大家认为他可能不是来自爱诺朗的人
that he might be considered as not coming from Aerelon?

408
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,730
也许是从卡布里卡来的人
Maybe, I don't know, Caprica?

409
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,820
卡布里卡人 当一个卡布里卡人
Caprica? Oh, to be Caprican.

410
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,570
政治  文化  艺术 科学  学识的温床
The seat of politics, culture, art, science, learning.

411
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,160
而爱诺朗呢?  丑陋的土褐色星球
And what was Aerelon? Just a drab, ugly rock,

412
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:53,080
被判为是12殖民地的粮仓
condemned to be the food basket for the 12 worlds.

413
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,670
我们也受到像佣人  劳工  工人阶级一般的对待
And that's how we were treated, like servants, like laborers, like working class.

414
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,760
你倒是很符合标准  轮机长
You know, you would have fitted right in there, Chief.

415
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,510
很多人都喜欢手工劳动 到酒馆喝杯酒
Lots of men who liked to work with their hands and grab a pint down at the pub

416
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,270
找人打一架后来结束一天的辛劳
and finish off the evening with a good old-fashioned fight.

417
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,440
对了 我在过完18岁生日后 就离开了爱诺朗
Oh, yes, I left Aerelon after my 18 birthday.

418
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:24,910
抛下了我的家族 我的遗产 所有的一切
I turned my back on my family, on my heritage, all of them.

419
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,120
当然说也白说了 一切都毁于一旦了
Of course, it doesn't matter. They're all dead now.

420
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,620
你也清楚这里也没有那些东西吧?
You do realize that none of that exists here.

421
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,040
从技工嘴里说出的话
Coming from the mouth of a mechanic.

422
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,460
我们保留了民主
We've kept democracy.

423
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,050
我们有政府 有权利  有选举
We have government, we have rights, we have elections...

424
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,720
那你完全应该感到高兴才对  不是吗?
Well, then you should feel perfectly happy, shouldn't you?

425
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,560
非常舒适自在 回家吧 别烦我
Perfectly at ease. Go home! Leave me in peace!

426
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,560
这正是贵族阶级所期盼的
After all, that's what the aristocracy wants.

427
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,560
想要让工人阶级觉得自己受人爱戴
It wants the working class to feel looked after,

428
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,150
而他们其实吃的却是主人的残羹冷炙
while they scrabble around for scraps from the master's table.

429
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,820
书的结尾我提出了一个问题 
There's a question I ask at the end of my book.

430
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,660
免得你再去看了
I'll save you the trouble of reading it.

431
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,410
你真的认为这支舰队 
Do you honestly believe that the Fleet will ever be commanded

432
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,330
可以由不姓亚当玛的人来统治吗?
by somebody whose last name is not Adama?

433
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,050
就是这样  轮机长
There it is, Chief.

434
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,470
对贵族阶级是一套规矩
One set of rules for the aristocracy,

435
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,300
对我们是一套规矩
and one set of rules for the rest of us.

436
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,450
我们已经给那些经过抽签决定新来的工人分配了任务
FENNER: We've given assignments to all the new workers from the lottery.

437
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,370
看来你让他们马上投入了工作
Looks like you put 'em right to work.

438
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:35,330
恩  对  他们还好  虽然不太稳重 但是会好起来的
Yeah, yeah. They're okay. They're a little skittish, but they'll catch on.

439
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,540
我们上次的问题就出在这里
Right up here's where we had the problem last time.

440
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,170
多次出现齿轮滑动  温度变动
We got all kinds of gear slippage, temperature variations.

441
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,960
我们并不知道残渣没有被烧掉
We didn't know the dross wasn't getting burned off.

442
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,470
是你们的不合格燃料?
And that's the bad fuel?

443
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,800
对  现在开始流动了 生产线上还有六个地方 
Yeah, it's running now, but we've got a half-dozen other places

444
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,180
可能会出现故障
down the line that could frak us.

445
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,720
怎么回事?
What's that?

446
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,640
好了  关闸
Whoa, that's it! Hit the switch!

447
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,100
不行  不行  卡住的时候不能关  整个系统都会失灵
No, no, no! Not when it's jammed! The whole system will seize up!

448
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,230
我们得找到卡住的地方 否则留在室内的矿石过热后 
Gotta find it. Otherwise, the ore that's still in the chambers will superheat

449
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,610
会产生连锁反应  把我们都炸飞
and set off a chain reaction that will blow us all to hell!

450
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,240
快  我们一定要让传送带动起来
Hurry! We've got to get this going!

451
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,950
在这里  就是这里
Right here! This is it!

452
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,070
找到了?  恩
You got it? Yeah!

453
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,370
把它弄出来
Get it out of there.

454
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,240
我没法抓到它
I can't get my hands around it.

455
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,330
快  拉一下 我抓不住它
Come on, just give it a yank! I can't get my hand on it!

456
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,710
小心  小心
Careful! Careful!

457
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,620
这下面太窄了 我进不去
It's too small. I can't get under it.

458
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,500
那边的矿石都热了 你们得快点让这东西动起来
We've got some hot rocks up there! You've got to get this thing started fast!

459
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,550
拉一下  拉一下  我就是抓不住它
Give it a yank! Give it a yank! I just can't get my hand around it!

460
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,260
抓不住
I can't get my hand on it!

461
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,890
我来试试 我来试试
I can try! I can try!

462
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,180
我也许能进去
Get in there! I can probably fit.

463
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,680
来吧  丹尼   如果弄好了 
Come on, Danny. Okay, if he clears it,

464
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,390
传送带会跳带 你要小心
the belt's gonna jump, so you gotta be careful.

465
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,270
从后面进去 抓到它
Way in the back. Got it.

466
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,520
小心  抓到了 抓到了
There you go, there you go. You got it. You got it.

467
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,320
好  小心点
You got it. Atta boy. Better... Be careful!

468
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,940
加油  丹尼 让它动起来
Come on, Danny, get a hold of it!

469
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,190
对  好样的 抓住它  拉住 
That's it! Atta boy! Now, grab it! Pull it!

470
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,740
往你这边拉 用力拉  
Pull it towards you! Pull hard!

471
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,990
用力拉 用力拉 
Come on! Pull hard, Danny!

472
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,660
这就对了
Yes! All right!

473
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,750
好样的 丹尼 干得好
Good work, Danny. Good work.

474
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,540
好样的  快出来 快出来
Atta boy, Danny. Get out of there. Come on out, come on out.

475
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,050
急救员!  急救员!
Medic! Medic!

476
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,260
急救员快来!
Medic! Now!

477
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,050
放松  小兄弟  我们会照顾好你的
Take it easy, buddy. We got you. We're gonna work with you.

478
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,850
放松…    他重度…
Go ahead, take it easy... He's got multiple...

479
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,600
没事  小兄弟 你做得很好
FENNER: It's okay, buddy. You did a great job. A great job.

480
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,770
快进去
MAN: Get in there! Get in there!

481
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,610
好
SEELIX: Okay.

482
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,950
你会好的
You're gonna be okay.

483
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,670
还需要纱布   冷静   再拿些来
I need more gauze. Just calm down, that's it. Give me some more.

484
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,650
这地方停止作业了
This plant is off-line!

485
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,650
我们要罢工!
We're on strike!

486
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,070
需要什么吗  上尉?
You need something, Captain?

487
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,940
对 我他娘的是需要东西 需要我的蝮蛇机
Yeah, I frakking need something. I need my Viper.

488
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,110
抱歉  上尉  仅限于重要任务
Sorry, Captain. Vital missions only.

489
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,240
空中巡逻队已经出勤 我们做完工作了
CAP is already up. We did our job.

490
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,120
"重要任务"是什么意思?
What do you mean, vital missions only?

491
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,330
谁的命令?
Whose orders?

492
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,910
凯莉传达了蒂罗尔轮机长的命令
Cally relayed the orders from Chief Tyrol.

493
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,460
我们罢工了
We're on strike.

494
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,030
上将
Admiral.

495
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,080
你是否意识到你的甲板手们参与了停工活动?
Are you aware that your deck gang is participating in a work stoppage?

496
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,410
这叫做总罢工  长官  这是兵变
It's called a general strike, sir. It's a mutiny.

497
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,210
知道我们怎么处置叛徒么?
And do you know what we do with mutineers?

498
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,500
我们枪毙他们  轮机长
We shoot them, Chief.

499
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,680
我们这是在抛弃民众  上将
We're leaving people behind, Admiral.

500
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,350
民众被固定在他们的岗位 无法掌握自己的命运
People are locked into their jobs, they have no control over their lives.

501
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,850
没有权利
They have no say.

502
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,060
我们让他们听天由命 就像是我们把他们遗弃在了那个星球上
We're abandoning them to their fate. It's like we've marooned them on a planet.

503
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,020
问题不在这里
That is not the issue.

504
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,990
这艘战舰上的人不许违抗命令
The men and women on this ship are not allowed to disobey an order,

505
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,740
特别是为了支持什么狗屁劳资纠纷
especially in support of some kind of frakking labor dispute.

506
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,780
我们送出了空中巡逻队
We launched the CAP.

507
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,490
没人擅自离岗  我们并没让舰队面临危险
No one has abandoned their post. We're not putting anyone in danger.

508
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,950
这是兵变
This is mutiny.

509
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,790
到此为止
And it stops now.

510
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:20,130
上将 我只想和总统坐下来谈一些事
Admiral, all I want is a sit-down with the President.

511
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,930
我是上将
This is the Admiral.

512
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,680
逮捕凯莉・蒂罗尔
Arrest Cally Tyrol.

513
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,060
把她直接武装押送到右舷修理厂
Take her under armed guard directly to the starboard repair bay.

514
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,860
"修理厂"?  你要干什么?
The repair bay? What are you doing?

515
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,110
我要让她靠着舱壁 把她作为叛徒枪毙
I'm gonna put her up against the bulkhead and I'm gonna shoot her as a mutineer.

516
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,900
你是不是疯了?
Are you out of your frakking mind?

517
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,820
凯莉只是按我命令行事
Cally was just following my orders.

518
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,700
她是带头人  所以第一个人就是她
She's a ringleader, so she goes first.

519
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,700
接着就是其他的甲板手 菲戈斯基 希里克丝 波吕克斯…
Then the rest of your deck gang, Figurski, Seelix, Pollux...

520
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,130
你不会这么做的
You won't do this.

521
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,550
我们有一个儿子
We have a son.

522
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,340
给我听好
Understand me.

523
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:05,590
这艘战舰的生死存亡也许正依赖于那些接到命令
The very survival of this ship may depend on someone getting an order

524
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,550
但却不愿执行命令的人
that they don't want to do.

525
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
如果他们稍有迟疑
And if they hesitate,

526
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,060
如果他们有时把上级命令当作耳旁风
if they feel that orders are sometimes optional,

527
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,520
那这艘战舰就会灭亡
then this ship will perish,

528
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,610
你的儿子也会有此下场 全人类也会灭亡
and so will your son and the entire human race.

529
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,450
我确实不想这么做 轮机长
I don't want to do this, Chief.

530
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:30,580
但为了确保这艘战舰 这支舰队不会被摧毁
But I will put 10 Callys up against the wall

531
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,410
就算有十个凯莉在 我也会把她们送上刑场
to make sure that this ship and this fleet are not destroyed.

532
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,590
好吧
Fine.

533
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,470
我停止这次罢工
I'll call it off.

534
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,760
我是上将
This is the Admiral.

535
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,350
凯莉被拘留了么?
Do you have Cally in custody?

536
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,690
让她听电话  把门打开
Put her on. Open the door.

537
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,580
你还好吧?      不用担心我 
You okay? CALLY: Don't worry about me.

538
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,290
我进过禁闭室
I've been in a brig before.

539
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,910
一切都很顺利
TYROL: Everything's okay.

540
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,420
停止罢工
Call off the strike.

541
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,750
他们让步了?
Did they cave?

542
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,250
恩
Yeah.

543
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,300
停止吧
Call it off.

544
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,880
我就知道   交给我吧
I knew it. I'll take care of it.

545
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,800
加伦  我为你自豪
Galen, I'm proud of you.

546
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,180
把电话给陆战队员吧
Give the phone to the Marine.

547
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,940
放了她
Release her.

548
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,320
你可以走了 轮机长
You can go now, Chief.

549
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:53,490
你不是还要和总统讨论一些事么
I thought you had something that you wanted to discuss with the President.

550
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,220
还要一杯吗?      不用了
Would you like another drink? I think I've had enough.

551
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,930
总统阁下
Madam President,

552
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:14,180
我发现入伍后士兵的兵种完全取决于他们的出生地在哪里
I've seen people drafted into service based purely on where they were born.

553
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,470
也取决于他们所拥有的技能
They've also been selected based on their skills.

554
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,690
而这正是由他们的出生地所决定的
Which is a result of where they were born.

555
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,190
卡布里卡人很可能是专业人员
Capricans are more likely to be professionals.

556
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,860
爱诺朗人很可能是农民
Aerelons are more likely to be farmers.

557
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,360
这就是残酷的现实
It's just a fact of life.

558
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,940
可以改变的现实
It's a fact I can't change.

559
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:32,110
那倒是真的 不过我认为我们可以公平竞争
True. But I think we can level the playing field.

560
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,290
舰队里 每天都有许多脏活累活
There are a lot of dirty jobs that need to be done every day in this fleet,

561
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,830
清洗  修理 简单维护 诸如此类的工作
cleaning, hauling, low-level maintenance, things like that.

562
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,830
我认为这类工作应该分配给...
These are the kind of jobs that I think should be allocated to people,

563
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,470
那些像您一样的人 恕我冒昧
well, people like yourself. No offense.

564
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,050
我不介意 继续说
None taken. Go ahead.

565
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,890
让殖民者一号上的一些人干些脏活
Let some of the people on Colonial One get their hands dirty for a change.

566
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,850
就这么定了 还有什么?
Done. What else?

567
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,560
在危险与高压环境下工作的人
People that are in dangerous and high stress jobs

568
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,360
需要轮换连续作业
need to be rotated out for R and R.

569
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,900
如果要这么做  我们就需要正式的培训计划
Now, in order to do that, we need a formal training program.

570
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:14,160
我们可以稍后再谈培训计划
We can talk about a training program later, but right now I need to focus

571
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,580
但当前我们的重点是保持现有的劳动力
on maintaining the work force that we have,

572
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,250
而这正是工会失职的地方
and this is gonna have to be an area where the union gives ground.

573
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,710
"工会"?
The union?

574
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,540
不好意思 你不是代表殖民地工人联盟 
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were engaged in collective bargaining

575
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,550
进行集体谈判么
on behalf of the Colonial Workers' Alliance.

576
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,510
如果不是这样...    总统阁下
If that's not the case, then... Madam President,

577
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,880
那个工会已经在新卡布里卡上灭亡了
that union died on New Caprica.

578
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,760
轮机长 这支舰队里的工人 
Chief, the workers in this fleet, they need someone

579
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,180
需要一位可以代表他们权益的人
to represent them and their interests.

580
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,980
如果这个社会确实正演变成...
And if this society is becoming truly polarized

581
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:46,020
平稳的政治阶层与被剥夺公民权的下层社会的两极分化
between an entrenched political class and a disenfranchised underclass,

582
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,730
那我们就命不久矣了
we are doomed.

583
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,360
用不着赛昂人来消灭我们 我们就会毁了我们自己
We won't need the Cylons to destroy us, we'll destroy ourselves.

584
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,200
到达地球的舰队根本就无法代表殖民社会
The fleet that arrives at Earth will not represent Colonial society at all.

585
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,700
我愿意用尽毕生精力来为实现那个殖民社会而奋斗
I am willing to fight for that society until my dying breath.

586
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,830
如果你也能这么做 那就再好不过了
I would love it if you would fight for that society as well.

587
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,040
嗯
Hmm.

588
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,460
我会的
I will.

589
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,010
我会的  总统阁下 我会这么做的
I will, Madam President. I will.

590
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:25,020
波吕克斯和赫歇耳 你们负责为4372号加燃料
TYROL: Pollux and Herschel, you are on fueling 4372.

591
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,940
蒂罗尔轮机长?
STARBUCK: Chief Tyrol.

592
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,060
上尉
Hey, Captain.

593
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,650
我的一名傻蛋今早没有…
Chief, one of my nuggets failed to show up

594
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,650
出席基础飞行训练课
for basic flight instruction this morning.

595
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,780
我很遗憾  上尉
Sorry to hear that, Captain.

596
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,990
也许你能告诉我 戴安娜・希里克丝在哪里?
So maybe you can tell me where the hell Diana Seelix is?

597
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,910
希里克丝  快来
Seelix. Front and center.

598
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,370
飞行训练课在20分钟以前就开始了
Flight instruction began 20 minutes ago, Seelix.

599
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,330
你想不想当驾驶员了?
You want to be a pilot or not?

600
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,460
想  长官  可我以为…
Yes, sir, but I thought that...

601
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,130
我让你以为的时候你再以为  傻蛋
You will think when I tell you to think, nugget.

602
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,340
你该看一下"全天计划"
And you might want to look at the plan of the day.

603
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,510
这样你就知道该去哪里
Because then, maybe you'll know where you're supposed to be

604
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,090
也就能按时到达
and you might actually get there on time.

605
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,140
没有你的制服和军靴
And you're out of uniform, to boot.

606
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,470
不好意思  上尉 这事交给我吧
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. I think I can handle that.

607
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,440
谢谢  轮机长  拿着
Thank you, Chief. Hold this.

608
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,070
要想驾驶蝮蛇机  你必须是军官
You have to be an officer to fly Vipers.

609
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,280
这你也知道
You know that.

610
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,790
卫士  敬礼
Detail. Hand-salute!

611
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,260
谢谢  轮机长  谢谢您
Thank you, Chief. Thank you.

612
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
祝贺你  少尉
Congratulations, Ensign.

613
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,300
好感人的场面 可你在20分钟之前 
All right, this is all very touching, but you were supposed to be

614
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,720
就应该到达预备室
in Ready Room Four 20 minutes ago, Ensign,

615
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:47,730
也就是说  少尉 你第一天报到就落后了
which means that you are falling behind on your first day.

616
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,100
快去
So move it.

617
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,650
别看他  快去  快去
Don't look at him! Move it! Move it!

618
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,320
对她好点
Be nice.
