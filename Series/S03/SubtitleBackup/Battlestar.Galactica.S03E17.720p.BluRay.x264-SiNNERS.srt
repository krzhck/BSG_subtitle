1
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,350
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》前情回顾
STARBUCK: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,360
李奥本是一个非常狡猾的赛昂人 他会想方设法迷惑你
ADAMA: Leoben is a very clever Cylon. He's gonna try to get into your head.

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,320
我们还没正式介绍过
We haven't been properly introduced.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,530
我是李奥本
I'm Leoben.

5
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,820
审讯那个赛昂人
ROSLIN: I want the Cylon interrogated.

6
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,490
动手
Do it.

7
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,780
这一切都发生过
This has happened before.

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,950
这一切会再次重演
And all of it will happen again.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,250
你的一切皆已是命中注定
Your destiny has already been written.

10
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,500
我看过你的X光片
I saw your x-rays.

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,460
你身上有多处童年时留下的骨折
A lot of old fractures from childhood.

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,420
有虐儿倾向的父母...
Children of abusive parents

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,380
他们的子女 通常也会惧怕自己重蹈覆辙
often fear passing along that abuse to their own children.

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,130
出去!
Get out!

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,380
我是在帮助你  卡拉
I'm trying to help you, Kara.

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,010
只想让你认清你生活的本来面目
I only want you to see the truth of your life.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,430
你饱受煎熬的原因 你长久以来痛苦挣扎的原因
The reason why you suffered. The reason why you struggled for so long.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,270
如果李奥本所言有关你和你那与众不同的宿命确有其事呢?
What if there's something to what Leoben said about you and a special destiny?

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,310
"卡拉・瑟瑞丝和她与众不同的宿命"?
Kara Thrace and her special destiny?

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,610
听起来更像是一支不入流的乐队
That sounds more like a bad cover band, Sam.

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,910
这颗新星看起来确实像神庙里的曼荼罗
ADAMA: I think the nova does look like the mandala inside this temple.

22
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,990
也许它正是一块...
Maybe it was a road sign.

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,870
指明他们去向的路标
Showing the direction that they headed to next.

24
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,750
让我好奇的是...
HELO: I'm curious about something.

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,750
你在卡布里卡的家里所作的那幅画
Those paintings you did, from your apartment on Caprica.

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,920
这是神庙里的图案
This was on the Temple.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,090
你的那幅画从哪里得来的灵感?
Where did you get the idea to paint yours?

28
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,430
我从小就那么乱涂了 我喜欢那个图案
That's just something I've been doodling since I was a kid. I like the pattern.

29
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,180
他们在4000年前建造的神庙
Well, they built the Temple 4,000 years ago.

30
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,640
怎么了?
What is it?

31
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,060
李奥本有一次曾说过...
Just something Leoben said once.

32
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,480
我有我的宿命
That I had a destiny.

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,020
一切都已是命中注定
That it had already been written.

34
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,200
怎么了?
What's up?

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,960
没事  睡觉去
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

36
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,630
起得早啊
You're up early.

37
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,010
你不也一样
You, too.

38
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
恩
Yeah.

39
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,980
赫拉总是做噩梦
Hera gets these nightmares.

40
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,060
醒来以后  又哭又闹   全身哆嗦
Wakes up crying and shaking.

41
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,230
哄她睡着以后  我倒精神了
By the time we calm her down and get her back to sleep, I'm wide awake.

42
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,780
在新卡布里卡上经历的那些破事 真的给她留下了心理阴影
All that crap she went through on New Caprica really left its mark on her.

43
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,490
恩  我理解她
Yeah, I know just how she feels.

44
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,200
要是你没给我看过那张讨厌的曼荼罗图片多好
Wish you never would've showed me the picture of that frakking mandala.

45
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,410
我他妈每晚都会梦见…
I dream about it and that bastard Leoben

46
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,830
它和李奥本那个狗杂种
every gods-damned night.

47
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,460
觉得自己都快精神失常了
I feel like I'm losing my mind here.

48
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,760
卡拉  仁川号上有一名心理医生
You know, Kara, there's a psychiatrist aboard Inchon Velle.

49
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,590
我们已经为赫拉安排了一个约会 你可以考虑去她那里看一下
We've made an appointment for Hera. Maybe you should think about seeing her.

50
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,140
逗我?
You kidding me?

51
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,890
大部分心理医生比他们的患者还猪头
Most shrinks are more frakked up than their patients are.

52
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,650
去拜访一下住在道格维尔的那位先知吧
You know, you might want to check out that oracle camped in Dogsville.

53
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,940
据说她会解梦
People say she interprets dreams.

54
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,860
能占星卜命  洞悉玄机
Sees things in them. Predicts events.

55
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,080
嗨
Hey.

56
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,870
没事吧?
You okay?

57
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
不知道
I don't know.

58
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,770
喂?
Hello?

59
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,090
奥罗拉女神
BRENN: The goddess Aurora.

60
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,520
拿去吧 归你了
Take it. It's yours.

61
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,930
我要这玩意有什么用?
What the hell am I going to do with this?

62
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,770
到时你自会明白
You'll know when the time comes.

63
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
坐吧
Sit.

64
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,930
我… 我睡不着
I... I can't sleep.

65
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,850
总是做噩梦
Having these nightmares.

66
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,310
梦到那个赛昂人
About the Cylon.

67
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,690
那个在新卡布里卡上监禁你的赛昂人
The one who held you captive on New Caprica,

68
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,650
李奥本
Leoben.

69
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,200
我知道他只是…
I know that he was just...

70
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,870
他要比你还要了解你自己
He knows you better than you know yourself,

71
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,330
卡拉・瑟瑞丝
Kara Thrace.

72
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,950
他看清了你的本来面目
He sees the truth about you.

73
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,120
你的宿命
About your destiny.

74
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,830
你并不…
You don't...

75
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,710
够了
Enough of that.

76
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,010
我唯一的宿命就是成为世界级的冒失鬼
The only destiny I have is as a world-class frak-up.

77
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,930
专门伤害关心你的人
Who hurts everyone she cares about.

78
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,430
这是拜你母亲所赐  对吧?
That was your mother's gift to you, wasn't it?

79
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,980
一位信奉苦痛有益于灵魂的女人生下了你
You were born to a woman who believed suffering was good for the soul,

80
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,730
所以你只能受苦
so you suffered.

81
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,900
你的一生与痛苦为伴
BOTH: Your life is a testament to pain.

82
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,400
你想要相信这一点 因为…
You want to believe it because

83
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,820
这说明你时运不济...  这说明你时运不济
it means that you're bad luck. ... it means that you're bad luck.

84
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,950
你像是癌细胞 你像是癌细胞
You're like a cancer You're like a cancer

85
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,080
需要被切除 需要被切除
that needs to be removed. that needs to be removed.

86
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,960
因为你每天都能听到她的声音 因为你每天都能听到她的声音
Because you hear her voice every day. Because you hear her voice every day.

87
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,870
而你希望她所说的都是真的 而你希望她所说的都是真的
And you want her to be right. And you want her to be right.

88
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,630
李奥本对我说的话  是别人告诉你的吗?
Somebody told you what Leoben said to me.

89
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,340
你对别人说过这些话么?
Did you ever tell anyone about that?

90
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,890
你错误地领会了你母亲的意图 卡拉
You learned the wrong lesson from your mother, Kara.

91
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,650
你把信息和信使弄混淆了
You confused the messenger with the message.

92
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,990
你母亲要教授给你的是其他东西
Your mother was trying to teach you something else.

93
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,530
你他妈并不了解我母亲
You don't know crap about my mother.

94
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,580
李奥本了解
Leoben does.

95
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,660
他能看到那些图案
He sees the patterns.

96
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,170
看到它们如何拼凑到一起   闭嘴
Sees how it all fits together. Shut up.

97
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,960
他会来找你
BRENN: He's coming for you.

98
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,170
很快
Soon.

99
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,210
你他妈给我闭嘴
Shut the frak up.

100
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,260
你无法阻止他
You can't stop him.

101
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,760
他会为你领路
And he will show you the way.

102
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,240
还有半小时  我就要乘飞梭走了
I'm on a shuttle in a half an hour.

103
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,900
去请假和我走吧
Ask for your leave and come with me.

104
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,780
你还可以休息一下
You could use the downtime.

105
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,240
好有诱惑力
It sounds tempting.

106
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,700
那就来吧
So do it.

107
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,410
没有条件 我们都不用谈论感情问题
No strings, okay? We don't even have to talk about our relationship.

108
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,250
我考虑一下
I'll think about it.

109
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,500
就是说没戏了
Which means, "No. "

110
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,760
有些事我不愿去提
You know, I hate to say this.

111
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,350
可那个神道的先知说得很有道理
But that whack-job oracle, she's got a point.

112
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,560
早在李奥本之前  你母亲就已经把你教坏了
Your mother frakked up your head long before Leoben ever got to you.

113
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,190
有很多事让她操心 山姆
She was dealing with a lot, Sam.

114
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,280
她说我与别的孩子不同
She told me that I was different from other kids.

115
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,110
我要成为一名像她一样的战士
That I needed to be a warrior, like her.

116
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,740
她教我"畏惧会让你死掉"
Taught me that fear gets you killed,

117
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,700
"愤怒会让你活命"
and anger keeps you alive.

118
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,330
她做的那些让你气愤的事还少么?
Well, she gave you plenty to be angry about, didn't she?

119
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,330
因为你没叠被
Split your head open with a broomstick handle

120
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,300
就用笤帚把劈你的脑袋
because you didn't make your bed?

121
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,130
我有没有告诉过你我怎么报复她?
I ever tell you how I got back at her?

122
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,720
没有
No.

123
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,760
在第一次赛昂大战期间 
During the first Cylon war,

124
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,260
她随第一批陆战队驻守在麦加
she was stationed with the first marines on Mehidra.

125
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,680
你可不知道那些丛林里有多臭
Stinking jungles you wouldn't believe.

126
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,980
从此 她就对昆虫有了恐惧症
Had this phobia of insects for the rest of her life.

127
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,310
讨厌那些该死的东西
Hated the damn things.

128
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,070
于是我就去买了一些橡胶制成的虫子
So I go out and I buy a bunch of rubber bugs

129
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,320
然后溜进了她的衣橱
and I slip into her closet

130
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,910
把它们都放到了她的鞋子上
and I put them all over her shoes.

131
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,070
然后呢?
And?

132
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,540
把她吓得魂都没了
She screamed her frakking head off.

133
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,000
然后我走进她的房间
I go in

134
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,340
看到她正用鞋子来拍它们
and she's trying to smash them with her shoes

135
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,840
结果越拍它们跳得越厉害
but that's just making them bounce around even more.

136
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,510
你肯定挨收拾了
You must have caught hell for that.

137
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,140
她抓住我的手按在门框上 然后用门来夹
She grabbed my hand, held it in the doorjamb and slammed the door.

138
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,980
真没想到
Frak me.

139
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,360
不过也算值得了
It was worth it, though.

140
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,410
上尉  我是卡拉狄加  我们有几个阀门失灵
MAN: Captain, it's Galactica. We've had a couple of valve failures.

141
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,450
要重新开始注水
We're re-starting the unrep.

142
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,580
这可好
STARBUCK: That's just great.

143
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,080
热狗  别急  我们还要在这里呆上三个小时
Hotdog, settle in. We're gonna be out here for another three hours.

144
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,880
热狗  你在干什么?
Hotdog, what the hell are you doing?

145
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,050
再次享受蓝天白云
HOTDOG: Enjoying blue skies again.

146
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,260
这也是我唯一留恋新卡布里卡的地方
About the only thing I miss about New Caprica.

147
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,410
卡拉狄加  我是星芭  好戏开始了
Galactica, it's Starbuck. Showtime.

148
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,370
一架不明战机出现在我右方一点45000尺的云层里  作战开始
Bogey. My right one, in the soup at 45. Committing.

149
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,870
星芭  我是热狗 未发现敌机   加速
Starbuck, Hotdog. No joy. Press.

150
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,300
取消注水 立即取出那些燃料管
Abort the un-rep. Unhook those fuel lines immediately.

151
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,130
补给船  我是卡拉狄加
Refueling ships, Galactica.

152
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,630
立即停止一切补给行动
Immediate. Cease all underway replenishment ops.

153
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,220
雷达上可以看到星芭和热狗
Sir, we've got both Starbuck and Hotdog on dradis

154
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,800
并未发现不明战机
but no contact on the bogey.

155
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,060
能看到就算走运了
We're lucky we can see anything.

156
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,930
自从我们到了这里...
That planet's synchrotron radiation

157
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,890
那颗行星的同步辐射 
has been kicking the crap out of every dradis in the fleet

158
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,100
就把雷达都搞得一团糟
since we got here.

159
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,150
要找一处安稳之地藏起来为舰队补给就要付出代价
Price you pay for a good place to hide and refuel the fleet.

160
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,110
看来也是赛昂突袭机绝佳的藏身之地
Looks like it's also a good place for hiding a Cylon Raider.

161
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,580
星芭  我是阿波罗  什么情况?
Starbuck, Apollo. What have you got?

162
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,500
阿波罗 有一架重型突袭机正和我们在云层里捉迷藏
Apollo, we've got one turkey playing hide and seek in the clouds.

163
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,630
没有同伴  采取攻击
No sparrows. Engaging offensive.

164
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,250
一架重型突袭机 没有战机护航
One heavy Raider. No fighter escort.

165
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,050
雷达上还是没有敌机
GAETA: Still no bandits on dradis.

166
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,470
如果让那混蛋跳跃走 赛昂人在几分钟内就会出现在我们眼前
If that bastard jumps, the Cylons could be all over us in minutes.

167
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,840
警告舰队准备进行紧急跳跃
Alert the fleet to stand by for an emergency jump.

168
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,140
星芭  我是热狗  没有发现突袭机 我快看不到你了
Starbuck, Hotdog. No visual on your Raider and I'm losing you!

169
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,520
见鬼  星芭 什么都看不见了 重复一遍 我在云层里看不到你
Damn it, Starbuck. Blind! I say again, I lost you in the clouds!

170
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,880
星芭 我们在雷达上未发现你所说的敌机
APOLLO: Starbuck, we have no dradis contact on your bogey.

171
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,420
你能看到吗?
Do you have visual?

172
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,090
能  他躲在了云层里  只是藏在了风暴系统里
Affirmative. He's hiding in the clouds. He just ducked into the storm system.

173
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,010
你能看到他吗?  能看到他吗?
APOLLO: Do you see? Do you see him?

174
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,180
卡拉狄加 我是星芭 准备开火
Galactica, Starbuck. Tally. Weapons hot.

175
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,530
卡拉狄加 我是星芭 受到一次撞击 仍能飞行
Galactica, Starbuck. Took a hit. Still flying.

176
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,070
星芭儿  你能行吗?
APOLLO: Starbuck, are you nominal?

177
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,610
机腹受撞  但一切正常
STARBUCK: Got me under the chin. Everything's green.

178
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,540
那架突袭机到底在哪里?
Where the hell is that Raider?

179
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,160
长官 星芭正在俯冲飞向该行星的最低海拔高度
Sir, Starbuck's dropping close to the planetary hard deck.

180
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,540
如果她保持航线 大气密度将使她…
If she stays on course, the atmospheric density

181
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,330
无法再次返回轨道
will keep her from reaching orbit again.

182
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,460
压力会把她像易拉罐一样挤扁
And then the pressure will crush her like a cheap soda can.

183
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,300
星芭  你飞得太低了 改变航向  爬升
APOLLO: Starbuck, you're getting too low. Break off and climb.

184
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,270
重复一遍 星芭  你飞得太低  改变航向  爬升
I repeat. Starbuck, you're getting too low. Break off and climb.

185
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
星芭!
Starbuck.

186
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,480
星芭  在你被压碎之前快上拉
Starbuck, pull out before you don't have the smash to regain orbit.

187
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,820
卡拉  说话
Kara, come in.

188
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,910
她到底要去那里?
ADAMA: Where the hell is she going?

189
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,290
星芭...
APOLLO: Starbuck?

190
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,410
离开那里
Get out of there.

191
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,420
星芭  说话  收到了吗?
Starbuck, come in. Do you read?

192
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,840
星芭  你飞得太低  改变航向  爬升
Starbuck, you're getting too low. Break off and climb.

193
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
飞起来
Get up.

194
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,050
热狗  你能看到星芭吗?
Hotdog, do you have a visual on Starbuck?

195
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,510
星芭  说话  收到了吗?!  星芭  上拉!
Starbuck, come in! Do you read? Starbuck! Pull up!

196
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,840
这是命令 上拉
That is an order. Pull out!

197
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,770
阿波罗  我是星芭  照办
Apollo, Starbuck. Wilco.

198
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,900
来吧!
Come on!

199
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,100
哪里被撞了  轮机长?
Where'd I take the hits, Chief?

200
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,470
看来哪都没有  上尉
Looks like nowhere, Captain.

201
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,480
什么?  我感受到撞击了
What? I felt the impact!

202
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,940
该死的蝮蛇机像是撞在了墙上
Damn Viper felt like it hit a brick wall.

203
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,070
我们会继续检查 不过目前看来毫发无伤
Well, we'll keep checking. But so far, not a scratch.

204
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,580
天杀的  肯定就在那里    再放一遍
Gods damn it, it has to be there. Run it again.

205
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,750
已经看两遍了
We've watched it twice already.

206
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,380
那这就不是我的照相枪
Then this isn't my gun camera film.

207
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,550
别人一天都没开过枪
ATHENA: No one else pulled a trigger all day.

208
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,220
我们对比了卡拉狄加与猛禽机上的雷达记录
We checked Galactica's dradis records against the ones in our Raptor.

209
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,340
根本没有赛昂人的影子
There was no paint on your Cylon at all.

210
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,350
大家都清楚 雷达到了这星球附近的时候靠不住
And we all know that dradis can be wonky near this planet, Karl.

211
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,060
也许在你开火之前  突袭机就已经跳跃走了
Maybe the Raider jumped away before you opened fire.

212
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,890
或许本来就没有
Or maybe it never existed to begin with.

213
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,110
它肯定在那里
It was there.

214
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,370
要让她禁飞?
Gonna ground her?

215
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,790
科特尔说她身体合格  可却是一个容易激动的疯子
Cottle says she's physically fit, but an emotional basket case.

216
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,920
在和平时期我们都得被禁飞
In peacetime, he'd ground us all.

217
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,210
那还是把球踢给你了
So it falls back on you.

218
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
对
Yeah.

219
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,350
就算是个冒失鬼 她仍旧是我手下最出色的蝮蛇机驾驶员
Even screwed up, she's still the best Viper driver I've got.

220
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,520
有时要承认我们中最出色的一员 
Sometimes it's hard to admit that the best of us

221
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,060
也会累垮并不是容易的事
can burn out.

222
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,560
你认为她是这样吗?
Do you think she has?

223
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,650
不知道
I don't know.

224
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,610
我想作为一名技艺超群的蝮蛇机驾驶员...
I think her identity as a steely-eyed Viper jock

225
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,910
是唯一让她不至于崩溃的原因
is the only thing holding her together.

226
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,450
所以如果我让她禁飞...
So, then, if I ground her...

227
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,090
每个人都有忧虑不安的时候
Everyone gets rattled sometimes.

228
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,260
但根本问题是...
But the bottom line is,

229
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,140
当子弹纷飞的时候
when the bullets start to fly,

230
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
她是否能应付得来?
can she handle it?

231
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,240
当你"光荣"的时候  你想被放在哪里?
So, where do you want to go when you bite the big one?

232
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,450
我想在小凯身边
I want to go right there, next to Kat.

233
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,540
一位水上漂的蝮蛇机驾驶员
A water-walking Viper jock.

234
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,670
十足的讨厌鬼  可有她做你僚机却是好帮手
A royal pain in the ass, but a hell of a stick to have on your wing.

235
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,800
你可以把我放在这里
You can put me right here.

236
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,350
放在达克和罗拉旁边
Next to Duck and Nora.

237
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,180
玩牌高手
Good card players.

238
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,060
永远有此陪伴也不错
Nice way to spend eternity.

239
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,810
好 如果谁先挂了 
Okay. So whoever croaks first, the other one makes sure

240
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,900
另一个人可要把照片放对地方 说定了?
that their picture goes in the right place. Deal?

241
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,910
一言为定
Deal.

242
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,080
老头子对我的作战报告有什么看法?
So, what did the old man have to say about my combat report?

243
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,830
"星芭终于陷入了困境"?
Starbuck's finally gone off the deep end.

244
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,000
"无法胜任工作"?
Unfit for duty?

245
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,010
他说我是队长 由我决定
He said I'm the CAG. It's my call.

246
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,550
啊…
Ah.

247
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,520
那你怎么说?
And what do you say?

248
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,860
我说比起雷达 我更相信你的眼睛
Well, I say I'd trust your eyes over dradis any day of the week.

249
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,530
可能确实有东西在那里  在云中消失了
Something could have been there and vanished in the cloud cover.

250
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,610
你认为我不是疯子?
So, you don't think I'm nuts?

251
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,320
我可没那么说 你是个胡说八道的疯子
I didn't say that. You're a raving lunatic.

252
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,450
我从第一次看到你 你就疯疯癫癫的
As demented and deranged as the first day I met you.

253
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,410
你是个混球
And you're a bastard.

254
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,790
听着
Look,

255
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,920
压力可以让我们大家都变得神经质
stress has made us all twitchy.

256
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,170
在新卡布里卡上那个赛昂人对你所做的一些事之后
After what that Cylon put you through on New Caprica,

257
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,180
有些事你并没说
you've had more than your share.

258
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,850
休息一下吧
Get some rest

259
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,140
不然你真的会开始出现幻觉
or you will start seeing things.

260
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,770
好
Yeah.

261
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,570
这样还有六艘民用船等待补给
That leaves six civvies in line to refuel.

262
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,410
那再等10个小时  我们就完工了?
ROSLIN: So, another 10 hours and we're done.

263
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,780
恩
ADAMA: Yeah.

264
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,660
星芭?
Starbuck?

265
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,290
你听到了什么?
What do you hear?

266
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,630
只有雨声
Nothing but the rain.

267
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,000
那就带上你的枪  把猫请进来
Then grab your gun and bring in the cat.

268
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,340
遵命  上将
Wilco, Admiral.

269
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,930
总统阁下
Madam President.

270
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,140
上尉
Captain.

271
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,260
感觉怎么样?
How is it out there?

272
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,060
我会检讨的
Hell of a view.

273
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,480
我们就快完成补给了
We're almost to the finish line.

274
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,190
可以跳出这个星系
Then we can jump the hell out of this system.

275
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,480
同心协力
So say we all.

276
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,860
嗯…
Um...

277
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,400
抱歉  老大
Actually... Sorry, Boss.

278
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,700
有些东西要送给你
I have something for you.

279
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,040
我觉得拿这个作为您木船模型的破浪神不错
I thought that it would be a nice figurehead for your model ship.

280
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,040
奥罗拉
Aurora.

281
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,210
黎明女神  对
Goddess of the dawn. Yeah.

282
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,130
她会带来晨星与和风
She brings the morning star and a fair wind.

283
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,550
一个崭新的开始
A fresh start.

284
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,010
谢谢
Thank you.

285
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,810
祝你好运
Good hunting.

286
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,520
谢谢
Thank you.

287
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,650
线束装配?
Harness assembly?

288
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,900
腰肩部固定销已经安装好
Lap and shoulder retaining pins installed.

289
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,990
收缩卷正确
Retraction reel correct.

290
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,910
刚连接块锁定指示器  显示黄旗
Disconnect block locking indicator. Yellow flag visible.

291
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,000
没事吧  上尉?
TYROL: You all right, Captain?

292
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
呃…
Uh...

293
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,010
让我单独呆一会  轮机长
Give me a minute here, Chief.

294
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,980
我们没说过吗?
WOMAN: Did we not talk about it?

295
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,570
快点 拜托  停下来!
Do it! Come on, do, it! Stop it!

296
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,550
少校
TYROL: Major.

297
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,010
她就那样坐在那里
She's just sitting there.

298
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,140
你和她谈过了么?
Well, did you talk to her?

299
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,890
你去和她谈谈吧
You talk to her.

300
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,490
替我难过?
Feeling sorry for me?

301
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,340
卡拉… 每个人都有忧虑不安的时候
Kara, everyone gets rattled.

302
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,670
即便是最出色的人
Even the best.

303
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,770
我不会回去了
I'm not going back out there.

304
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,890
我不相信我自己
I don't trust myself.

305
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,110
嗯
Hmm.

306
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,490
那就相信我
So trust me.

307
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,450
我做你的僚机
I'll fly your wing.

308
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,540
空军队长做我下手
The CAG flying my number two?

309
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,840
让我干什么都行
Whatever it takes.

310
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,760
你和小杜的事怎么样了?
How are things with you and Dee?

311
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,890
呃…
Uh...

312
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,100
挺好的
You know. Good.

313
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
不
No.

314
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,190
比那还要强
Better than good.

315
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,360
最好的时候
Best they've ever been.

316
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,360
我替你高兴
I'm happy for you.

317
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,370
真的
Really.

318
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,830
有意思的是 在我们一起经历了这么多以后
It's funny though, after all we've been through

319
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,250
我们又回到了原点
we are right back where we started.

320
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,470
你还是空军队长  我还是你的王牌蝮蛇机驾驶员
You're CAG and I am your hotshot problem pilot.

321
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,270
看来我们只能是这样的关系了
I guess that's all we'll ever be now, huh?

322
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,830
星芭  我是阿波罗  感觉怎么样?
Starbuck, Apollo. How we doing?

323
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,380
好极了
Copacetic.

324
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,300
再过30分钟 我们就返回基地
Another 30 minutes and we head back to the barn.

325
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,430
见鬼 阿波罗  一架敌机 在我右边三点钟方向出现
Damn it. Apollo! One turkey, my right, three,

326
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,310
十点钟高度  潜入云层中
level at 10, ducking in and out of the clouds.

327
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,940
追击
Engaging.

328
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,110
星芭  我是阿波罗 未发现敌机
Starbuck, Apollo. No joy.

329
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,860
星芭  我是卡拉狄加
Starbuck, Galactica.

330
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,860
雷达上并未发现赛昂人
No dradis contact on your Cylon.

331
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,490
阿波罗  我是星芭
Apollo, Starbuck.

332
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,990
准备开火 作战开始
Weapons hot. Committing.

333
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,660
这次我要把这混蛋拖回去 扔到机库里
This time I'm gonna drag him back and dump his sorry ass on the hangar deck.

334
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,460
全体舰队一级戒备 解开所有燃料管
Set the fleet at condition one. Uncouple the hoses!

335
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,100
星芭  我是阿波罗 我无法在雷达上看到你
Starbuck, Apollo. I've lost you on dradis.

336
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,690
我什么都不看见
I'm blind!

337
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:53,860
星芭  我是阿波罗  重复一遍 我看不到你或突袭机
Starbuck, Apollo. I repeat. I've got no sign of you or the Raider.

338
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
星芭 报告
Starbuck! Report!

339
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,440
星芭  报告
Starbuck, report!

340
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,110
我是阿波罗  收到了吗?
This is Apollo. Do you read me?

341
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,530
星芭  报告
Starbuck! Report!

342
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,790
星芭!
Starbuck!

343
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,560
星芭  我的能见度为零
Starbuck, I have zero visibility.

344
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,730
星芭  你在吗?
Starbuck, are you out there?

345
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,060
卡拉!
Kara!

346
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,280
早安  特尔斐
D.J.: Good morning, Delphi.

347
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,080
今天又是炎热的一天 是去海滩的时候了
Got another hot one in store for you today. Time to head for the beach.

348
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,120
天气预报员说…
Weatherman says we can...

349
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,660
太阳照屁股了
Rise and shine.

350
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,800
今天可是个大日子
We have a big day ahead of us.

351
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,550
得了
Come on.

352
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,190
我没在这里
I'm not here.

353
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,990
我在寒冷的屋外
I'm out cold.

354
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,290
不然就是在赛昂母舰上
Or on a Cylon ship 

355
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,610
你把我拉进来和你玩那个荒诞的心理游戏
and you drag me to play your frakking mind games.

356
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,950
没有游戏  卡拉
No games, Kara.

357
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,080
是关于你宿命的事
That's not your destiny.

358
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,130
我自己谱写我的命运
I write my own destiny.

359
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,250
不是我绘制的那个符号  卡拉
I didn't paint that symbol, Kara.

360
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,220
而是你
You did.

361
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,970
你在云里
You saw it again.

362
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,430
又看到了它
In the clouds.

363
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
对吧?
Didn't you?

364
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,060
你没有告诉别人
But you didn't tell anyone else.

365
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,900
因为你陷于其中
Because you're drawn to it.

366
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,740
你能感受到它的吸引力
You feel its pull.

367
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,990
你想飞到它的里面 穿过它
You want to fly into it. You want to cross over.

368
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,160
但你害怕
But you're afraid.

369
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,960
怕什么?  就怕一片他妈的云彩?
Afraid of what? A frakking cloud?

370
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,970
未知的事情
Of the unknown.

371
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,050
死亡
Death.

372
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,680
你所有的特技都是一部戏
All your high-wire stunts have been an act.

373
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,350
一次又一次
Time after time,

374
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,030
你化险为夷  侥幸逃脱
you skip to the edge of the abyss, then dance away again.

375
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,780
可你却从未克服过你的恐惧
But you've never really conquered your fear.

376
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,950
自从那一天开始...
You've been afraid.

377
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,950
你就一直忧心忡忡
Ever since that day.

378
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,080
哪一天?
What day?

379
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,020
这一切都发生过
All of this has happened before

380
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,770
这一切会再次重演
and will happen again.

381
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,070
没锁
SOCRATA: It's open.

382
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,210
你好  妈妈
Hello, Mama.

383
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,920
没想到这只是六年前
It's hard to believe it's only six years ago.

384
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
你看起来年轻好多
You look so much younger.

385
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,050
是的
I was.

386
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,140
你真的做到了
SOCRATA: So, you really did it.

387
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,010
家里第一个当上军官的人
First person in the family to become an officer.

388
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,270
轮也该轮到我了
What is the world coming to?

389
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:02,190
卡拉 他们告诉我你是他们所见过最好的天生驾驶员的料
Kara, they tell me that you're the best natural pilot they've ever seen.

390
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,150
我第一次坐进驾驶舱的时候 我就...
First time I got in that cockpit, I just

391
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,700
觉得我属于那里
felt like I belonged.

392
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,870
那些都是天生的
All that natural ability,

393
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,910
不过你还是以班上第16名的成绩毕业的
and still, you only graduated sixteenth in your class.

394
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,580
117侯选人中第16名  妈妈
Sixteenth out of 117 cadets, Mama.

395
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,380
这有什么可骄傲的?
Why are you proud of that?

396
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,380
你应该是第一名
You should have been number one.

397
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,760
他们告诉我你的缺点够从这里排到爱诺朗了
They tell me that you have left a trail of demerits from here to Aerilon.

398
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,090
你无法无纪
You're undisciplined, you have no respect for authority...

399
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,720
这不关你的事了  妈妈
It's none of your business, anymore.

400
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,270
你有天分  卡拉
You have a gift, Kara.

401
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,232
我一直心里有数
I've always known that, 

402
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,190
我不会让你就此荒废掉
here, in my gut and I am not going to let you piss that away.

403
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,230
你与众不同 难道你不明白吗?
You're special. Don't you understand that?

404
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,110
不  我不明白
No, I'm not!

405
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,990
你就不能放弃你那愚蠢的梦想吗?
Would you let go of that stupid dream of yours?

406
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:55,490
你没能当上军官  我很遗憾
Look, I am sorry as hell that you never made officer

407
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,950
这间破房子和墙上那些勋章 
and all you have to show for a life of dedication

408
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,210
是你为国尽忠的唯一证明
is this crappy apartment and that frakking medal on the wall.

409
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,580
但我不会去弥补你的遗憾
But I will not make up for it all.

410
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,710
我做不到
I can't.

411
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,840
说得对  因为你就是个轻言放弃的人
Yeah, because you're a quitter.

412
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,920
一向如此
You always have been.

413
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,520
你去过肿瘤专家那里了?
You went to an oncologist?

414
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,520
放下  别碰
Hey! Put that down! Don't touch that!

415
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,110
你要怎么办?
What are you going to do about this?

416
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
不去管它
Nothing.

417
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,370
没什么办法  已经转移了
There's nothing to do. It's metastasized.

418
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,620
游戏结束了
Game is over.

419
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,610
我很遗憾  妈妈
I'm sorry, Mama.

420
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,240
别可怜我
I don't want your pity.

421
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,490
你还没得到我的怜悯
You haven't got it.

422
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,370
你想替别人难过?
You want to feel sorry for someone?

423
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,330
去为你自己难过吧
Feel sorry for yourself.

424
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,500
你得找别的方法  来督促自己了
You're gonna have to find another way to motivate your ass.

425
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,380
我陪不了你多久了
I'm not gonna be around to do it any longer.

426
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,010
可别告诉我还要哭啊
Oh, don't tell me you're gonna cry about it now.

427
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,590
我用不着在这里听这些话
You know what? I don't need this. I'm gonna...

428
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,680
我要走出那道门
I'm gonna walk out that door

429
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,480
你就自己走完  这段悲惨的日子吧
and you can look at it every frakking miserable day you have left

430
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,520
我永远也不会再迈过这道门槛
and know that I am never gonna come back through it again.

431
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,020
卡拉
Kara!

432
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,410
然后你就一直跑  对吧?
You kept running, didn't you?

433
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,620
跑了好几条街
For blocks.

434
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,100
她就一直在这里守着
LEOBEN: She waited here

435
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,650
等了五周 希望你能回来
for five weeks, hoping you'd come back.

436
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,190
她在孤独中死去
She died alone.

437
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,900
我害怕我会看不下去
I was afraid I couldn't watch.

438
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,200
还为时不晚
It's not too late.

439
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,170
她还在等你
She's waiting still.

440
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,200
妈妈
Mama.

441
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,460
你回来了
You came back.

442
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,970
想不到你还留着这些东西
I can't believe you kept all this.

443
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,560
所有的一切都留着
Everything.

444
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,310
一直如此
Always.

445
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,790
妈妈
Mama.

446
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,010
有事要发生了
Something's about to happen.

447
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,270
您还记得您一直让我有所准备的那件事吗?
You know that thing that you were trying to prepare me for?

448
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,770
我不知道自己是否能做到
I don't know if I can do it.

449
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,440
你能行的  能行的
Oh, yes, you can. You can.

450
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,280
为什么你这么肯定?
How can you be sure?

451
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,580
因为你是我的女儿
You're my daughter.

452
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,740
死亡并没有那么可怕
LEOBEN: See? There's nothing so terrible about death.

453
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:33,500
当你最终面对它的时候 它是如此美丽
When you finally face it, it's beautiful.

454
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
你自由了
You're free now.

455
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,300
可以找回真正的自己了
To become who you really are.

456
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,550
你不是李奥本
You're not Leoben.

457
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,390
从没说过我是
Never said I was.

458
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:59,690
我来这里 是为了让你准备好通过那道门
I'm here to prepare you to pass through the next door.

459
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:04,190
参透生死
To discover what hovers in the space between life and death.

460
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,340
星芭 我是阿波罗 我无法在雷达上看到你
Starbuck, Apollo. I lost you on dradis.

461
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,470
重复一遍...
I say again,

462
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,300
我看不到你
I've lost you.

463
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,890
启用应答机识别  我会确定你的方位
Squawk ident. I'll try to get a fix on you.

464
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,680
卡拉!
Kara!

465
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,560
李
STARBUCK: Lee.

466
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,900
我不怕了
I'm not afraid anymore.

467
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,020
再说一遍?
Say again?

468
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,190
我不怕了
I'm not afraid anymore.

469
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
她应该害怕
She should be afraid.

470
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,030
她已经很接近最低海拔高度了
She's damn close to the hard deck.

471
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,330
阿波罗离她也不远  压力会把他俩都挤个粉碎
Apollo's not far behind. The pressure will crush them both.

472
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,120
快  李 把她弄出来
Come on, Lee. Get her out of there.

473
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,580
90秒后到达最低海拔高度
GAETA: Ninety seconds to hard deck.

474
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,750
卡拉  听我说
All right, Kara. Listen to me.

475
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,790
别去管那该死的"烤面包机"了
Forget the damn toaster.

476
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,170
迅速爬升  不然你就死定了
Climb now or you're dead.

477
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,310
我们还能逃出来  还没有到达无法挽回的地步
We can still pull out of this. We haven't gone past the point of no return.

478
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,860
卡拉
Kara!

479
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,440
60秒后到达最低海拔高度
GAETA: Sixty seconds to hard deck.

480
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,740
小杜 按阿波罗上次的位置 
Dee, vector red section to Apollo's last known.

481
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,610
从一号管道派出待战机
Set alert Vipers to ready one.

482
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,410
热狗  汉克斯  转为715号
DUALLA: Hotdog, Hex, divert to 715.

483
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,490
天杀的  你在哪里?
Gods, Starbuck, where are you?

484
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,880
看到了 看到了 好
Visual. Visual. Okay.

485
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,880
卡拉  我来接你了
Kara, I'm coming to get you.

486
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,210
李...
STARBUCK: Lee.

487
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,550
让我们在另一边见吧
I'll see you on the other side.

488
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,890
卡拉  求你听我说… 回来
APOLLO: Kara, please. Listen to me. Come back.

489
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,510
就让我去吧
Just let me go.

490
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,560
天杀的  卡拉!
Gods damn it, Kara.

491
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,730
你给我回来!  回来!
You come back! Come back!

492
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,900
没关系
It's okay.

493
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,690
就让我去吧
Just let me go.

494
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,480
他们在等我
They're waiting for me.

495
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,830
不!
No!

496
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,250
不!!
No!

497
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,550
阿波罗!
Apollo!

498
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,510
离开那里!  取消任务!
Get out of there! Abort!

499
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,590
取消任务
Abort!

500
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,280
李 你看到她了吗? 能看到她吗?
Lee, do you have her in sight? Can you see her?

501
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,740
不能
APOLLO: Negative.

502
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,910
她…
She...

503
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,370
她进去了
She went in.

504
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,210
她进去了
She went in.

505
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,640
我们会立即派出搜救队
We're sending in the search and rescue birds right now.

506
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,810
会找到她的
We'll find her.

507
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,150
不用  爸 没用了
APOLLO: No, Dad. It's no use.

508
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,400
她的战机已经变成了碎片
Her ship's in pieces.

509
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,780
她的战机已经变成了碎片
Her ship's in pieces.

510
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,650
她的战机
Her ship

511
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:39,700
...没了
is lost.
