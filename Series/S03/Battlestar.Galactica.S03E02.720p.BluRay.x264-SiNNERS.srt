1
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,640
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》前情回顾
ADAMA: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,690
你杀我  我下载到新躯壳  我回来  我们重新开始
You kill me, I download, I come back, we start over.

3
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,280
你会挽着我的肩膀
You're gonna hold me in your arms.

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,070
你会和我说你爱我
You're gonna tell me that you love me.

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,780
我不属于这里  让我走
I don't belong here! Let me out!

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,740
你从哪得到这些消息的  谁是你的线人?
Where are you getting this stuff? Who's your source?

7
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,160
我不知道
I have no idea.

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,120
线人不愿意暴露他们的身份
The source won't tell me what their name is.

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,960
或许对我们更安全
It's probably safer for all of us.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,750
总统先生?    早上好 盖塔
Mr. President? Good morning, Gaeta.

11
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,840
是殖民地的信号  识别码吻合
It's a Colonial transmission. The recognition codes match.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,380
对 我们和地面取得了联系
Oh, yeah, we've got a link to the ground.

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,840
我们收到个信号
TYROL: We've got a signal.

14
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,800
说什么?    坚持住 我们来接你们了
What's it say? "Have hope. We're coming for you. "

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,010
我们联系上了!
RACETRACK: We made contact!

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,100
泰上校成立了抵抗组织反抗赛昂人
Colonel Tigh has formed an insurgent group against the Cylons,

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,100
现在他们已经准备好等待指示…
and now they're ready and waiting for instructions

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,060
来协调救援行动
on how to coordinate the rescue effort.

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,690
会好起来的
It's gonna be okay.

20
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,020
谁是我们的下一个目标
TIGH: What's our next target?

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,150
这是今天拿到的
TYROL: I got these today.

22
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,400
是新卡布里卡警察学校
They're security plans for the graduation ceremony

23
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,740
毕业典礼的安保计划
of the New Caprica Police Academy.

24
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,910
最乐观估计 警察人数在200左右
Our best guess puts the total police force at around 200.

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,580
我甚至无法相信哪怕只有20个人
ROSLIN: I wouldn't have believed there'd be 20 people

26
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,950
会背叛自己的同胞
who would turn against their own kind.

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,160
我不喜欢这样 上校 我们越限了
I don't like this one, Colonel. I think we're the ones crossing the line here.

28
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,330
他是个战士  军士长
He's a soldier, Chief.

29
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,710
这不是我们第一次把战士派上有去无回的战场中了
Not the first time we've sent a soldier on a one-way mission.

30
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,750
放话出去 谁替赛昂人卖命 就是我们的目标
TIGH: Send a message. You work with the Cylons, you're a target.

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,510
赛昂人可不加什么区分  我们也没有
No boundaries for the Cylons, there's no boundaries for us!

32
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,930
我们围捕那些反叛者的领袖 然后公开处死他们
We round up the leaders of the insurgency and we execute them publicly.

33
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,770
发个消息说刽子手来了
Send a message that the gloves are coming off.

34
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,830
现在  所有重要人物都被拘禁起来了
Everyone of importance is being looked at right now.

35
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,040
你也不能幸免
You're no exception.

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,080
我能帮助你  劳拉
I can help you, Laura,

37
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,120
但我却帮不了我自己
in ways I cannot help myself.

38
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,510
我能保护你
I can protect you,

39
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,420
但是你必须明白  形势已经改变
but you have to understand the situation has changed now.

40
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,550
抵抗活动已经出格了
The insurgency has crossed the line.

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,260
自杀式爆炸袭击
Suicide bombings.

42
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,770
这太可恶了
It's abhorrent.

43
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,810
这与我们所信仰的向背而弛  
It's contrary to everything that we believe in.

44
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,360
所以你...
So you...

45
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,440
你和我  我们将...
You and I, we will...

46
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,570
我们将要公开谴责这样的行动
We will publicly condemn these tactics.

47
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,820
它们不能被合法化  以任何形式
They cannot be legitimized in any shape or form.

48
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,410
这样的行动毕竟让赛昂人感到了恐惧
There is something that scares the Cylons after all.

49
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,710
人体炸弹应该使我们全都感到恐惧
I should think using men and women as human bombs should scare us all.

50
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,080
绝望的人们采取绝望的做法
Desperate people take desperate measures.

51
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,710
好吧  看着我的眼睛
All right, look me in the eye.

52
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,380
注视我的眼睛  并告诉我你赞成
Look me in the eye and tell me that you approve

53
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,380
让年轻的男女胸口绑着炸弹
of sending young men and women into crowded places

54
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,340
走进喧闹的人群
with explosives strapped to their chests.

55
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,480
我等着你注视我的眼睛并说你赞成这么做
I'm waiting for you to look me in the eye and tell me that you approve!

56
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,700
33人被杀死了
Thirty-three people killed,

57
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,240
而他们的过错不过是穿上了警察制服 
and their only crime was putting on a police uniform,

58
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,700
只不过是想给混乱的地区带来秩序    秩序?
trying to bring some order to the chaos out there. Order?

59
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,080
通过在深夜里逮捕无辜的人
By arresting innocent people in the dead of night,

60
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,580
没有任何审判就无限期地扣留他们 折磨他们
detaining them indefinitely without charge, torturing them...

61
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,800
等等 没人受到折磨    ...为了获取情报
Now wait a minute. Nobody's been tortured! ... for information!

62
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,420
这话去跟泰上校说吧
Tell that to Colonel Tigh.

63
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,680
没人受到折磨
Nobody has been tortured.

64
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,810
我们打住吧
We're done here.

65
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,360
我希望你理解眼下形势严峻
I hope you understand the severity of the situation

66
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,740
我请求你顺从你的良心
and ask you to obey the dictates of your conscience,

67
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,450
那也是我一直在做的
which is what I've always done.

68
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,830
对此  我毫不怀疑
Of that I have no doubt.

69
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,630
请把这位可爱女士的鞋还给她
Please give this lovely lady her shoes back,

70
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,260
然后让她离开这里
then get her out of here.

71
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,470
戒严现在生效
MAN ON PA: Curfew is now in effect.

72
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,390
在街道上的任何人都将受到严厉惩罚
There should be no people on the street without clearance.

73
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,650
戒严现在生效
Curfew is now in effect.

74
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,490
在街道上的任何人都将受到严厉惩罚
There should be no people on the street without clearance.

75
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,100
你明白给你的命令了吗  队长?  一切都清楚吗?
Do you understand your orders, Captain? Everything clear?

76
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,100
是的  长官        很好
Yes, sir. Good.

77
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,730
不要担心  我们会在后面支援你们
Don't worry, we have your back.

78
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,530
你听说了吗?  赛昂人削减了食物配给
Did you hear? The Cylons cut food rations today.

79
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,370
我们听说了
We heard.

80
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,460
与猛禽下一次联络的时间还剩多少?
How long before the next Raptor transmission?

81
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,330
两分钟
Two minutes.

82
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,550
他们想要关闭市场
Yeah, they're talking about shutting down the marketplace.

83
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,630
认为那里有安全隐患
It's a security risk.

84
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,970
我们会换个目标
We'll shift targets.

85
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,430
你原本要袭击市场?
You were gonna hit the marketplace.

86
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,560
市场  那里全是平民
The market, full of civilians.

87
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,810
这太疯狂了
This is crazy.

88
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,230
我们要搞清楚我们站在哪一边
You know, we need to figure out whose side we're on.

89
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,900
我们站在哪一边?
Which side are we on?

90
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,070
我们站在魔鬼这边  军士长
We're on the side of the demons, Chief.

91
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,860
我们是天国花园里的邪恶之人  被死亡的力量驱使着
We're evil men in the gardens of paradise, sent by the forces of death

92
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,450
无论我们到哪里  都传播破坏与毁灭
to spread devastation and destruction wherever we go.

93
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,660
我很惊讶你连这都不知道
I'm surprised you didn't know that.

94
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,670
联系上了
TYROL: Contact.

95
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,800
他们准备好接收情报了
Get ready for the sitrep.

96
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,310
发送两次  保险起见
Send it twice, just to make sure.

97
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,040
这是需要逮捕并送往监狱的那些人的名单
CAVIL: Here are the names of those to be arrested and sent to detention.

98
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,080
我...
I...

99
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,540
其中一些人我认识
I know some of these people.

100
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,710
我确信你认识他们
I'm sure you do.

101
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,380
他们都是抵抗份子  杰米  我们必须打破暴力循环
They're all insurgents, Jammer. We have to break the cycle of violence.

102
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,180
好了  整装出发
Okay, suit up.

103
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,150
不久你们就不必再戴这个了
You won't have to wear those much longer.

104
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,730
最终人们将把你们视为英雄
Eventually, your people will see you as heroes.

105
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,490
但不是今晚
Not tonight.

106
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,490
5号至10号 他们在右边的帐篷
JAMMER: Take numbers five through 10. They're gonna be in tents to the right.

107
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,700
按名单顺序抓
Follow down to the end.

108
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,250
其余的人维护现场  明白了吗?
The rest of you guys have got to keep quiet, okay?

109
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,710
我们是新卡布里卡警察
MAN: This is the New Caprica Police!

110
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,670
你因参与暴乱而被逮捕了
You are under arrest for colluding with the insurgency!

111
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,090
别动 你被逮捕了
Don't move! You're under arrest!

112
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,260
你被逮捕了
You are under arrest.

113
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,800
这是NCP的突袭行动(NCP 新卡布里卡警察)  
This is an NCP raid! Get your hands up!

114
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,050
凯莉 过来    不 不
Cally, come here! No! No!

115
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,850
这是NCP的突袭行动 举起手来    放开我 不
This is an NCP raid. Get your hands up. Let go of me! No!

116
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,190
我的孩子!不!放开我!
My baby! No! No, let go of me!

117
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,360
不!
No!

118
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,700
嘿!别哭  别哭
Hey, no, no, no, no.

119
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,460
我在这  我在这  好了  别哭
I got you, I got you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There you go.

120
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,960
妈妈会回来的  她会没事的
Mommy's coming back. It's okay. It's okay.

121
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,510
他们的人数少了一点
Their numbers are a little thin.

122
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,600
这上面说  泰上校有1150名武装人员
It says here Tigh commands 1,150 armed effectives.

123
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,930
他们的人是少了一点
That's a lot less than he should have

124
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,900
就算加上前舰队的全部军官以及那里能召集到的所有人员...
if you count all former Fleet officers and enlisted available down there.

125
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,520
可能已经遭到重创了
He could be taking heavy losses.

126
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,320
他们提及了赛昂人的镇压
They mentioned a Cylon crackdown.

127
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,650
我们应该把抵抗组织中可用的机师解救出来
We should get a breakdown of available pilots in the insurgent group.

128
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,410
如果我们要做成这件事
Somebody's gotta fly those ships off the ground

129
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,660
就得有人去驾驶地面上的那些飞船
if we're gonna pull this off.

130
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,200
那些飞船哪也去不了
Those ships aren't going anywhere yet.

131
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,290
赛昂人已经把着陆的殖民飞船上的启动钥匙转移了
"The Cylons have removed launch keys from grounded colonial ships.

132
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,330
地点未知  泰罗尔说的
"Location unknown. " It came from Tyrol.

133
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,540
我们可以作出新的启动钥匙吗?
Can we manufacture new launch keys?

134
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,670
别提了
APOLLO: Forget it.

135
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,420
启动钥匙的设计原理惊人的复杂
The specs on launch keys are incredibly sophisticated.

136
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,630
将花费数周去研制
It would take weeks just to do the R and D.

137
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,300
最好是少和地面上的人
The best option is for Saul and the people on the ground

138
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,300
能找到原来的启动钥匙
to find the original launch keys.

139
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,970
假如原来的钥匙被销毁了呢?  
Assuming they weren't destroyed.

140
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,850
不可能
No. No way.

141
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,470
赛昂人会完好地保存它们  
The Cylons would want to keep them safe,

142
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,690
以防他们有一天可能需要使用
just in case they need to use one of those ships someday.

143
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,190
她说得对 钥匙肯定还在某个地方
She's right. The keys gotta still be there somewhere.

144
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,940
我们可以向抵抗组织投放一些武器
We can make a weapons drop to the insurgents.

145
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,070
他们熟悉投放地形
They know the lay of the land,

146
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,820
他们打击赛昂人已经有数月之久了
they've been hitting the Cylons in the teeth for months.

147
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,820
假设他们有了工具  他们就能自己找到钥匙
Give them the tools. They can find the keys themselves.

148
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,490
不  不行
APOLLO: No. No way.

149
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,490
你过于乐观了
The only thing you've got going for you so far

150
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,000
赛昂人已经将防御区缩小到只有五艘基地之星那么大了
is that the Cylons reduced their defense perimeter to just five base ships.

151
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,330
你把重型武器投放下去 他们肯定会知道…
You put heavy weaponry down there, they're gonna know for sure

152
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,830
我们与地面上的人有联系
that we're in contact with the population.

153
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,880
就会有十艘基地之星上来  你的计划就完蛋了
They'll call in 10 more base ships, and then your whole plan is frakked.

154
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,380
有意思  我以为这是我们的计划  长官
Funny. I thought this was our plan, sir.

155
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,142
继续
Moving on, 

156
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:23,260
军事计划一旦在手便会一直相随
the military plans you have in your hands are to be with you at all times.

157
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,520
他们为何把她抓了? 她什么事也没做
Why'd they pick her up? She hasn't done anything.

158
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,610
我们有一个孩子
We've got a baby, for Gods' sakes.

159
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,360
我不知道  我会努力查明原因
I don't know. I'll try to find out.

160
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,860
他们准备拘禁她多久?
How long are they gonna hold her?

161
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,360
拘留所由另一个部门掌管
The detention is run by a separate ministry.

162
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,620
他们没有给我们任何解释  为什么他们会抓...
They don't give us any reasons why they...

163
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,370
老天爷呀  菲里克斯
Gods damn it, Felix!

164
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,410
她什么事也没做  我们还有一个婴儿
She hasn't done anything. We've got a baby.

165
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,040
我知道  格伦  我很遗憾
I know, Galen. I'm sorry.

166
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,460
你怎么会这样?
How do you do it?

167
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
你为何会日复一日地帮助他们?
How do you help them day after day?

168
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,380
你将如何看待镜子中的自己?
How do you look yourself in the mirror?

169
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,760
我要去找我的儿子
I gotta get my son.

170
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,890
卡梅伦正看着他  但她还有自己的事情
Cameron's watching him, but she's got problems of her own.

171
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,310
军士长
Chief.

172
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,810
我会看看我能帮你什么忙 我会想办法找出原因的
I'll see what I can do. I'll see if there's something I can find out.

173
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,730
你为什么不尝试做些事情?
Why don't you try and do something?

174
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,850
你还好吗?  杰米  发生什么事了?
Hey, you okay? Jammer, what's going on?

175
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,640
我听说昨晚的事了 关于凯莉在那些名单上的事
I heard about last night. About Cally being on one of those lists.

176
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,100
我真的很遗憾
Yeah. I'm really sorry.

177
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,230
他妈的那些人类警察
Yeah. Frakking human police, huh?

178
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,440
如果你要问我  我说那是一群叛国贼
A bunch of traitors if you ask me.

179
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,320
那些参加警察的家伙
Some of those guys who joined up,

180
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,610
我希望他们的脑袋都开花  你知道吗?
I bet they're in over their heads, you know?

181
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,120
特别是让那些自杀炸弹...
Especially now with these suicide bombings.

182
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,870
起初他们认为他们是在做好事
At first, I bet you they thought they were doing something good, you know?

183
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,660
把赛昂人赶出街道 让我们自己维持治安
Get the Cylons off the streets, let us police our own.

184
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,580
他们是一群他妈的白痴
The police are frakking idiots.

185
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,630
他们想要什么?
What did they expect?

186
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,760
你知道那些家伙的名字吗?
You don't know any of those guys, do you? Any names?

187
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,930
名字? 完全不知道
Names? No. No, no idea.

188
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,430
该死
Damn.

189
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,470
凯莉怎样了? 为什么他们要把她抓起来?
What's up with Cally? Why did they put her in detention?

190
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,980
我不知道  她一件坏事都没干过
I don't know. She hasn't done a gods-damn thing.

191
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,190
我刚与盖塔聊过 他说他什么都不知道
I just talked to Gaeta. He says he doesn't know squat, or so he says.

192
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,650
盖塔是个好人  如果他知道什么...  
Gaeta's a good guy. If he knows something...

193
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,360
他是该死的通敌者
He's a frakking collaborator.

194
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,030
你知道什么? 如果有一天这一切都结束了
You know what? One day, when this is all over,

195
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,410
类似盖塔这样的人都会被绞死
guys like Gaeta are gonna get strung up.

196
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,910
而像你我这样的人
Guys like you and me, we're gonna be there,

197
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,910
则是负责将绳子打结的人
tying the knots, making them tight.

198
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,840
真是一段丑陋的日子
LEOBEN: It's been a couple of ugly days.

199
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,140
我知道你不关心这个  
I know you don't care about that,

200
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,560
可生命对于我们是有意义的
but life means something to us.

201
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,730
于是我决定向你展现生命是多么得珍贵
So I've decided to show you just how precious life can be,

202
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,110
即使在最艰难的日子里
how, even in the worst of times,

203
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,650
它也能让你恢复信念
it can restore your faith.

204
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,450
你还记得在卡布里卡的养殖场里的事吗?
Remember that breeding farm on Caprica?

205
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,660
我记得我把那地方给烧了
I remember I blew the frak out of the place.

206
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,750
但没有丧失所有东西
It wasn't a total loss.

207
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,870
我们抢救出一些东西
We were able to salvage certain things,

208
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,630
一些医学样本 例如你的卵巢
certain medical samples, like your ovary.

209
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,520
那是什么?
What's that?

210
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,500
这是凯西
This is Kacey.

211
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,840
凯西  这是卡拉 你的母亲
Kacey, this is Kara, your mother.

212
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,050
嗨
Hi.

213
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,900
不可思议
DUALLA: Unbelievable.

214
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,410
什么?
What?

215
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,660
上将决定派些人下到地面去
Admiral's decided to put some boots on the ground,

216
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,540
想要派一名军官下去
wants to send an officer as a liaison

217
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,460
充当我们与抵抗组织之间的联络人来协调援救行动
between us and the resistance elements on the planet to coordinate the rescue op.

218
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,210
很合理  有什么问题?
It makes sense. What's the problem?

219
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,340
派谁下去?
It's who he's sending.

220
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,760
他一定在开该死的玩笑  对不?
He's frakking kidding with this, right?

221
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,630
我也希望他是
I wish he were.

222
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,140
Hoshi先生  我要一驾猛禽5分钟内在机库甲板上准备完毕
Mr. Hoshi, I want a Raptor prepped and ready in five minutes on the hangar deck.

223
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,470
通知旗舰  我要登舰
Inform the flagship I'm coming aboard.

224
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,850
我要与上将开一个秘密会议
I want a private meeting with the Admiral.

225
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,020
是  长官
HOSHI: Aye, sir.

226
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,730
你想要干什么?
What are you gonna do?

227
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,230
干我很久都没干的事情
What I should have done a long time ago.

228
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,740
你不能这么做 她是赛昂人
You can't do this. She's a Cylon.

229
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,070
嗯  我相信她
Well, I trust her.

230
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,820
呃  这是个错误
Well, that's a mistake.

231
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,160
没错  那也是我的错误  对吧
Well, it'll be my mistake, won't it?

232
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,410
你在拿这艘船上所有人的生命去赌博
You are gambling with the lives of everyone on this ship.

233
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,040
还有我船上的每一个人
Everyone on my ship.

234
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,670
我不需要你来告诉我  什么是指挥官的责任
I don't need a lecture from you about the responsibilities of command.

235
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,590
我们的谈话结束了
We're done here.

236
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,970
我还没有说完 整个计划是一次不计后果的赌博
I'm not finished. This entire plan is a reckless gamble.

237
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,050
没错  你的确有权力让你指挥下的男男女女们去冒险
And yes, you certainly have the right to risk the lives of the men and women

238
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,100
但这不是重点
under your command, but that's not the issue.

239
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,180
重点是你在拿整个人类种族冒险
The issue is you are risking the lives of the entire human race.

240
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,890
我在试图拯救人类
I'm trying to save the human race.

241
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,100
不  不  你没在拯救 
No. No, you're not.

242
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,860
你没有看到这一点  现在  整个人类种族?
That's what you're not seeing. Right now, the human race,

243
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,360
好吧  那里有2000个人挤在平民船上
well, that's the 2,000 people huddled in those civilian ships

244
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,530
当赛昂人回来时  他们设法离开了
that managed to get away when the Cylons came back.

245
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,900
他们才是保险箱
They're the safe bet.

246
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,910
他们才是我们应该守卫的人
They're the ones who survived and we should guard,

247
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,030
就像我们在他们攻击殖民地后所做的那样
just like we did after the attack on the colonies.

248
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,830
莎伦能渗透那些防御
Sharon can penetrate the Cylon defenses.

249
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,870
这不是她的问题
It's not about her.

250
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,870
赛昂百夫长无法从其他人形赛昂中分辨出她来
The Centurions can't distinguish her from the other humanoid models.

251
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,080
你知道吗  上将?
Did you know that? Admiral...

252
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,040
他们是有意如此编程的
They were deliberately programmed that way.

253
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,920
赛昂人不想让他们变得有自我意识并会抗命
The Cylons didn't want them becoming self-aware and suddenly resisting orders.

254
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,760
他们可不想他们自己的机器起来造反
They didn't want their own robotic rebellion on their hands.

255
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,470
你可以欣赏这个讽刺
You can appreciate the irony.

256
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
爸
Dad...

257
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,020
我知道你的意思
I know what you're saying,

258
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,150
但我们要对我们所留下的人负责
but we have a responsibility to the people that we left behind.

259
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,770
记得罗丝琳说过的
Remember what Roslin said.

260
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,570
我们的首要责任是让人类种族生存下去
"Our first responsibility is to the survival of humanity. "

261
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,860
我们不能无视这一点
We can't lose sight of that.

262
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,990
自从这一年来
Over the last year,

263
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,080
我们已经无视了很多事情
we've lost sight of almost everything.

264
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,040
我们变得...软弱
We got soft.

265
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,760
如果我们现在回去新卡布里卡 我们就输了
But if we go back to New Caprica now, and we lose,

266
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,010
全没了
it's over.

267
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,640
人类种族完蛋了
Humanity just stops

268
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,520
上将服上的星星没有给你做这样赌博的权力
and an admiral's stars don't give you the right to make that gamble.

269
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,530
你是对的  儿子
You're right, Son.

270
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,160
你应该制定一些恢复搜寻地球的计划
You should make plans for resuming the search for Earth

271
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,290
利用帕伽索斯与平民船只的资源
with Pegasus and the civilian fleet.

272
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,660
帕伽索斯?那卡拉狄加怎么办?
With Pegasus? What about Galactica?

273
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,460
我知道我们为何会留下那些人
I know why we left those people behind.

274
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,630
我知道去那里是他们的选择 
And I know that it was their choice in the first place to be down there,

275
00:18:54,710 --> 00:19:00,800
同时  我意识到人类生存下来的重要性高于一切
and I realize that the survival of the human race outweighs anything else.

276
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,050
但这次...
But this time,

277
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,390
我无法继续这样认为 无法面对它
I can't live with it, can't face it.

278
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,070
也许我是懦夫 但我会回来的
Maybe I'm a coward, but I'm going back...

279
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,610
父亲  你没有机会
Dad, you won't have a chance.

280
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,320
我会回来的  儿子
I'm going back, Son.

281
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,500
我让你的卵子受精
LEOBEN: Once I fertilized your egg,

282
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,580
放到一个人类女性体内 让她完成后面的步骤
we transferred it to a human woman who carried it to term.

283
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,710
她相当有趣
She's pretty, funny,

284
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,800
灿烂的笑容
great smile.

285
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,340
你会喜欢她的
You would have liked her.

286
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:46,810
虽然怀她的母亲死于难产 凯西的心从未动摇过
Although her mother died during childbirth, Kacey's heart never failed.

287
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,980
我猜她希望与你生活在一起
I guess she gets that will to live from you.

288
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,980
我已看到了她的未来
I've seen her path.

289
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,030
虽然艰难  但一切都值得
It's difficult but rewarding.

290
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,780
她将在一生中了解上帝的意志
She'll know the mind of God in this lifetime.

291
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,200
她能看到别人看不到的东西
She'll see patterns that others do not see.

292
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,620
她也许是从我这里得到如此纯洁的精神
She probably gets that spiritual clarity from me.

293
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,290
她很快就会感到饥饿 桌上有食物
She'll be hungry soon. There's food on the table.

294
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,470
你不会让你自己的小孩饿死  对吧
You wouldn't let your own child starve, would you?

295
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,680
这不是我的小孩 我甚至不知道它是不是一个人类
It's not my child. I don't even know if it's human.

296
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,270
半人类 而且你知道她是你的孩子 只是你不愿意承认
Half human. I mean, you know that she's yours. You just won't admit it.

297
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,440
该死的你准备去哪?
Where the frak are you going?

298
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,810
把这玩意带走
Take this with you!

299
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,570
别把这玩意拉下了
Hey! Don't leave me alone with this!

300
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,740
妈的
Frak.

301
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,370
我不知道你是谁或你是什么 但我知道我不是你妈妈
I don't know who or what you are, but I do know this. I'm not your mother.

302
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,420
我也不关心这是否有用 我也不关心赛昂人是否会停止
I don't care that it's effective. I don't care that the Cylons can't stop it.

303
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,000
这是个错误
It's wrong.

304
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,760
不要再有自杀式炸弹  上校 你明白吗?
No more suicide bombings, Colonel. You understand?

305
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,800
你现在为赛昂人工作吗?
What, are you working for the Cylons now?

306
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,190
抱歉  我不应该打你
I'm sorry. There was no excuse for that.

307
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:22,110
你看到了吧  类似这样的小事 他们已经不再在乎了
You see, little things like that, they don't matter anymore.

308
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,490
事实上  没有他妈的东西他们会在乎了
In fact, not too frakking much really matters anymore.

309
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,450
我已经在这里找到了工作  女士 也是唯一的工作
I've got one job here, lady, and one job only,

310
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,410
就是瓦解赛昂人
to destruct the Cylons,

311
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,540
让他们对任他们摆布的蝼蚁感到恐惧
make them worry about the anthill they've stirred up down here,

312
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,580
他们会转移注意力 当老头子回来时 会躲过他们的视线
so they're distracted and out of position when the old man shows up in orbit.

313
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,380
炸弹攻击已经引起了赛昂人的注意
The bombings? They got the Cylons' attention.

314
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,590
它们真的引起了他们的注意 而且我不会放弃的
They really got their attention. And I am not giving that up.

315
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,550
我们在谈论的是那些把自己炸成碎片的人们
ROSLIN: We are talking about people blowing themselves up.

316
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:55,680
你要知道  某些时候  我觉得你的血管里都是些冷水
You know, sometimes I think that you've got ice water in those veins

317
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,270
而另外一些时候 你又只是个天真的学校老师
and other times I think you're just a naive, little schoolteacher.

318
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,610
我已经在两次战争里将人送去进行自杀式任务
I've sent men on suicide missions in two wars now,

319
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,650
同时  也让我告诉你
and let me tell you something,

320
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,530
让他们驾驶着蝮蛇战机与
it don't make a gods-damn bit of difference

321
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,030
让他们走进检阅队伍 这两点并没有什么他妈的不同
whether they're riding in a Viper or walking out onto a parade ground.

322
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,540
最后  他们都只是死而已
In the end, they're just as dead.

323
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,670
因此请收起你的说教和你高尚的教条吧
So take your piety and your moralizing and your high-minded principles

324
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,300
带他们待在安全的地方直到这场战争结束
and stick them someplace safe until you're off this rock

325
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,760
以便能够再次坐回到你殖民地一号那张漂亮的凳子上去
and you're sitting in your nice, cushy chair on Colonial One again.

326
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,430
我还有一场仗要打
I've got a war to fight.

327
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,180
走起来  快走
MAN 1: Let's go. Move it.

328
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,100
往这边走  后面跟上
This way. Offload the rest.

329
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,650
从这里分开  走另一边
MAN 2: Let's go to isolation. Move!

330
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,570
拘留已经引起了不少怨声 招来了更多的敌人
BOOMER: The detentions are just causing more resentment and more enemies.

331
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,690
我们正在失去地面上人们的民心    快走
We're losing ground with the people. MAN 3: Let's move! Get going!

332
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,690
我知道 我们别无选择
I know. We don't have another option.

333
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,910
我们必须告诉大家自杀式炸弹袭击是不能容忍的
We have to send the message that suicide bombings won't be tolerated.

334
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:55,160
抱歉  长官  我能和你谈几句吗?
Excuse me, sir. Can I talk to you for a moment?

335
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,200
当然可以  杰米 我会跟上你的  
Yeah, sure, Jammer. We'll catch up later.

336
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,580
好
Okay.

337
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,130
我不知道应该如何开始说
Sir, I don't know exactly how to broach this,

338
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:09,010
我也不知道我要期望你做什么 但…
nor do I know exactly what I expect you to do about it, but since we were...

339
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,390
自从我们从卡拉狄加下来
Anyway, since we were back on Galactica...

340
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,260
行了  杰米  就直说吧
Yeah, Jammer, just spit it out.

341
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,890
我们在最后一次围捕行动中逮捕了泰罗尔军士长的妻子凯莉
We picked up Chief Tyrol's wife on the last raid. Cally.

342
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,640
她在拘留所里  我认为她在名单上
She's in detention. I think she's on the list.

343
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,720
妈的!
Frak!

344
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,520
凯西?
Kacey?

345
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,540
卡拉?
LEOBEN: Kara?

346
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,620
嗨  凯莉  是我  布玛尔
Hi, Cally. It's me. Boomer.

347
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,170
我希望我能有把枪
I wish I had a gun.

348
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,340
你还好吗?我意思是你的身体
Are you all right? Physically, I mean.

349
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,640
你想从我这里得到什么?
What do you want from me?

350
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,860
听着  每个人身上都发生了很多事情
Look, a lot's happened in everyone's life.

351
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,570
但我想你知道  我想让你和格伦知道
But I want you to know... I want you and Galen to know

352
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,030
我为你们高兴
that I'm happy for you,

353
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,740
尤其是你们组成了一个家庭
especially since you started a family.

354
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,540
这些都是我和他以前的梦想
Something that him and I talked about once before.

355
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,750
你能帮我离开这里吗?
Can you get me out of here?

356
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,510
我不知道  我对内部安全事务一无所知…
I don't know. I have nothing to do with internal security...

357
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:43,180
那么去死吧  莎伦  你这个愚蠢的该死的魔鬼
Then frak you, Sharon, you stupid, frakked-up toaster.

358
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,520
多少次我都想射死你
How many times do I have to shoot you, anyway?

359
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,560
如果你帮不到我  那就快滚
If you can't help me, then just go away and leave us alone!

360
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,080
所有人类准备出示身份
MAN ON PA: All human personnel prepare to present identification

361
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,290
在通过安全扫描前
before passing through security scanners.

362
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,000
出示你的ID
MAN 1: Have your IDs out.

363
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,630
继续    所有人都准备好自己的工作ID
Keep coming, keep coming... MAN 2: Everyone have both your IDs ready.

364
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,840
快走 有ID的出去
Step on up. Worker IDs out.

365
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,550
朝前走 你! 打开你的包
Straight ahead, move it. Hey, you! Open your bag! Open your bag!

366
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,100
截下她
Stop her!

367
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,990
23个赛昂人严重损坏  14个被迫销毁
Twenty-three Cylons critically wounded. Fourteen had to be euthanized.

368
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,070
他们也有伤亡  4个人类死了
They had casualties, too. Four human dead.

369
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,330
他妈是谁干的这事?  注意你的语言
Who gives a frak about that? Pardon my language.

370
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,830
变电站没了
The power substation is crippled.

371
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,290
半个城市没有电力供应
Almost half the city is without power

372
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,670
最乐观估计也要两周才能修好
and our best estimates put the repairs at two weeks.

373
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,460
你仍然觉得我们对人类过于苛刻了吗?
You still think we're being too hard on the human population?

374
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,840
我们面对的是一个非常严重  非常直接的问题
We have a very serious, very straightforward problem.

375
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:06,550
我们是要加强控制或是失去控制  这是事实
Either we increase control or we lose control. That's a fact.

376
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,060
我们觉得是使用更强硬手段的时候了
We think it's time for stronger measures.

377
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,310
我们同意
We agree.

378
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
我们同意
We agree.

379
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,610
我们也同意  你们呢?
We agree as well. How about you?

380
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,200
我们也同意
We agree also.

381
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,950
总之  我们大部分都同意
Most of us do, anyway.

382
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,580
那就够了
Enough.

383
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,080
这是什么?
What's this?

384
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,710
这是对所有列在后页上的拘留者
This orders the summary executions

385
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,540
执行处刑的命令
of all the detainees listed on the next page.

386
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,880
需要你签名
It requires your signature.

387
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
我的签名?
My signature?

388
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,010
你是总统
You're the President.

389
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,140
迟些再看  现在就签
Read it later. Sign now.

390
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,570
只因为你决定这样做
Just because you've decided to do this

391
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:02,070
并不意味着你需要把他拖进你的罪恶中
doesn't mean you need to drag him into sin with you.

392
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,070
别向我说教
Don't you lecture me about sin.

393
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,450
我不是那个开创…
I'm not the one who committed the first act

394
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,660
赛昂人杀赛昂人历史的那个人
of Cylon-on-Cylon violence in our history.

395
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,830
她在说些什么?
What's she talking about?

396
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,580
她在卡布里卡上用一块石头把我的脑袋砸爆了
She crushed my head in with a rock back on Caprica.

397
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,160
真有趣  她没告诉你
Interesting she didn't tell you.

398
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,670
有些事我不得不做  我并不以此为荣
It was something I had to do. I'm not proud of it.

399
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,670
这些都很有意思  非常有教育意义  签署这份命令
This is all very interesting, very edifying. Sign the order.

400
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,380
你们不需要我的签名
You don't need my signature.

401
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,510
嗯  事实上  我们需要
D'ANNA: Well, actually, we do.

402
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,720
我们是殖民地合法政府的同盟与朋友
We're here as allies and friends of the legitimate government of the Colonies.

403
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,300
你是总统  于是我们做的所有事情都需要你的签名
You are the President, so everything we do requires your signature.

404
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,600
换句话说  他们是在害怕
In other words, they're worried about what God might think

405
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,730
上帝会认为他们是在谋杀 他们在掩盖事实
if they commit murder. They're covering their existential asses.

406
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,150
我不会签的
I won't do it, all right? I won't do it.

407
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,820
你们还是用其他方法安抚你们的良心吧
You're going to have to solve your consciences some other way.

408
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,450
那我们只有换一个总统了
Then we'll find another president.

409
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,530
住手
Stop this!

410
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,830
这太疯狂了
This is crazy!

411
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,640
上帝呀 她会回来的
Dear God. She'll be back.

412
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,730
但是如果他向你按下扳机  你却不会回来
But if he pulls that trigger now, you won't.

413
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,360
快签字 
Sign it!

414
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,700
签字! 签上你的名字!快签!
Sign it! Sign your name! Sign it!

415
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,160
签字
Sign it! Sign it!

416
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,620
你对此无能为力  盖尤斯
CAPRICA SIX: There's nothing you can do, Gaius.

417
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,830
在这页纸上签字 会没事的
DORAL: Sign your name on that paper! It'll be okay.

418
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,370
是你
It's you.

419
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,380
帮帮我
Help me.

420
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,470
你必须签名  如果不签  他们会杀了你的
You have to sign it. They'll kill you if you don't.

421
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:52,010
签名!签名!签名!签上名字!签名!
Sign it! Sign! Sign! Sign your name! Sign it!

422
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,100
我办不到  我不会签的
I can't. I won't.

423
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,100
你不能强迫...
You can't force...

424
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,110
有时你必须做不想干的事 那样才能生存下来 为了将来的战斗
Sometimes you have to do things you hate, so you can survive to fight another day.

425
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,770
举起你的右手  重复我的话
Raise your right hand and repeat after me.

426
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,520
我  莎伦・阿格森
I, Sharon Agathon...

427
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,860
现在以我的信念与忠诚发誓
...do now pledge my faith and my loyalty...

428
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,230
现在以我的信念与忠诚发誓
...do now pledge my faith and my loyalty...

429
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,570
保护科波的十二个殖民地
...to the protection of the 12 Colonies of Kobol...

430
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,160
并执行上级的命令
...and will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors...

431
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,370
并执行上级的命令
...and will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors...

432
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,540
成为殖民舰队的
...as an officer...

433
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,040
一名军官
...in the Colonial Fleet.

434
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,340
祝贺你  少尉
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

435
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,090
真没想到我能活着看到这一天
I never thought I'd live to see the day.

436
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,680
我也是
Me, neither.

437
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,140
这是件好事 是你应得的
It looks good on you. It belongs on you.

438
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,110
这身制服对我来说意味着很多   莎伦
This uniform, it means a lot to me, Sharon.

439
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,820
我知道  西洛
I know it does, Helo.

440
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,070
对我来说也意味着很多
It means a lot to me, too.

441
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,490
我不会让它蒙羞
I won't betray it.

442
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,840
战机检查完毕 少尉
MAN: The bird checks out, Lieutenant.

443
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,380
谢谢
Thanks.

444
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,180
我能问你个问题吗? 你怎么知道的?
Can I ask you a question? How do you know?

445
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,140
我是说  你怎么知道你真的能信任我?
I mean, how do you really know that you can trust me?

446
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,720
我不知道
I don't.

447
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,310
但这就是信任
That's what trust is.

448
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,310
祝好运  少尉
Good hunting, Lieutenant.

449
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,830
嘿  还真有这事
That was really something.

450
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,420
原以为你会喜欢
I thought you might like that.

451
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,510
这回你没和我玩花样
But you... You didn't do the twist this time.

452
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,550
你们所说的… 你最后做的那个
What do you call... What's that deal you did right at the end?

453
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,600
你们称之什么来着?
What do you call that?

454
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,850
你说的是"旋动"
You mean the swirl?

455
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,180
旋动
Oh, the swirl.

456
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,520
哎哟  还真有这事
Boy, that's really something.

457
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,770
你说你想要一些难忘的东西
Well, you said you wanted something memorable.

458
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,780
少怎样了?
How is Saul?

459
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,490
很好
Fine.

460
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,780
他什么时候和起义者进行下一次会面
And when is his next meeting with the insurgents?

461
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,210
别否认这事 艾伦 我们知道他是他们的领导人
No point in denying it, Ellen. We know he's their leader.

462
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,420
你认为我们为什么会放他出去?
Why do you think we let him out of detention?

463
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,630
我想是因为那次做爱
I thought it was because of the twist.

464
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,100
是的  肯定是
Well, yes, that too, for sure.

465
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,850
但是放上校出去也能使抵抗活跃起来
But having the Colonel out and active with the resistance

466
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,640
提供给我们某些好处
presents us with certain advantages.

467
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,400
我不知道任何事情
I don't know anything about...

468
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,030
你的否定就能说明一些事  不是吗?
Let's just consider your denials as read, shall we?

469
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:39,740
我需要具体的地点 具体的时间
I want a specific place, I want a specific time

470
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,580
造反领导们的一次高级会议
for a very high-level meeting of the insurgency leadership.

471
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,710
如果我们没有得到的话  我们会接少回来
And if I don't get it, we pick up Saul again,

472
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,130
而这次  他失去的就不止是一只眼睛
and this time, he'll lose more than an eye.

473
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,850
明天  卡拉狄加会派出两架猛禽  几名海军陆战队士兵
Tomorrow, the Galactica is going to send two Raptors, several Marines

474
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:09,440
地面联络官员将要向我们作简要介绍
and a ground liaison officer is gonna help brief us on the rescue mission

475
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,190
并协调我们的营救任务
and help coordinate our evac plans.

476
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:15,520
该死  真的干了 谁是联络官员
I'll be damned. It's really happening. Who is the liaison officer?

477
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,490
莎伦
Sharon.

478
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,360
我希望这是你开的玩笑
I hope that's your idea of a joke.

479
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,780
阿达玛上将给了她制服和官职
Admiral Adama has given her a uniform and a billet.

480
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,120
她是一名服役军官了 我们没什么好说的
She is a serving officer, which is more than you can say

481
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,290
从技术上讲
about us, technically speaking.

482
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,170
老头子已经失去理智了  好吧
The old man's lost his mind all right.

483
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,960
集合地在哪?
Where's the rendezvous?

484
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,050
他们让我们决定
They left that up to us.

485
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,300
好吧  我的建议是
Okay, here's my suggestion.

486
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,430
如果他们跳跃到南部Breeder峡谷以外…
If they jump into Breeder's Canyon, out here in the southern range...

487
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,850
进来
Come.

488
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,440
嗨  小家伙们    嗨  艾伦
Hey, guys. Hey, Ellen.

489
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,280
像我刚才说的 如果他们跳到这里
Anyway, like I was saying, if they jump in here,

490
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,320
就不会被赛昂的雷达发现
they won't get picked up on Cylon dradis.

491
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,660
这有一段距离 要走很远的路
That's a long way out there, a lot of ground to cover by foot.

492
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,370
我知道 我们会在半路遇到他们  大概在这
SAM: I realize that. I'm gonna meet them halfway, right about here.

493
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,660
从空中很难发现我们 相当隐蔽
Now, there's good cover from the air, it's pretty isolated.

494
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,040
我们相信这点
I've gotta be sure.

495
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,750
这是我们举行的最重要的会议
It may be the most important meeting we're ever gonna have.

496
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,340
上校  我确定就是这里
Colonel, I'm sure. This is the place.

497
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,420
赛昂人在这里不会发现他们
The Cylons will not find them here.

498
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,340
好  给我地图
All right, give me the map.

499
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,220
记下这些信息了吗? 
Have you got the message memorized?

500
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,890
所有无线电频率
All the wireless freqs?

501
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,680
好的  也给我一份
All right, then give me the message, too.

502
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,400
我来吧  少  别起来
I'll do that, Saul. Don't get up.

503
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,730
谢谢
Thanks.

504
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,530
上校  我已经召集了一只6到8人的队伍
SAM: Colonel, I've assembled a team of about six to eight.

505
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,240
我们出去过好几次了
We've been out about half a dozen times.

506
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,530
如果需要的话  我们会带上一两天的食物
We have got provisions for a couple of days if we need them.

507
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,370
我们穿过河流
We have access to running water.

508
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,290
我对这一带了如指掌 会成功的
I know that place like the back of my hand. This is gonna work.

509
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,920
盖尤斯! 盖尤斯!
Gaius! Gaius!

510
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,220
你在这上面签了字?
Did you sign this?

511
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,220
告诉我你没签  盖尤斯!    不是现在  盖塔先生  
Tell me you didn't sign this, Gaius. Not now, Mr. Gaeta.

512
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,760
我非常疲倦    这是份处决书
I'm very tired. This is a death warrant!

513
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,640
你看过上面的名字吗?
Have you seen the names on this list?

514
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,930
你知道他们要做什么吗?
Do you have any idea what they're about to do out there?

515
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,560
你听见我说话了吗?
Are you listening to me?

516
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,860
我没有任何选择余地
I didn't have any choice.

517
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,320
你到底怎么了? 在这个目录上有200多人
What the hell's the matter with you? There are over 200 names on this list.

518
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,690
你看过这些名字了吗?
Have you even looked at the names?

519
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,820
看看这些名字  盖尤斯    我已经看过了
Look at the names, Gaius! I've seen them!

520
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,410
我已经看过了  行了吗?
I've seen them, all right?

521
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,790
我无能为力
There was nothing I could do.

522
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,340
出发
MAN: Let's go!

523
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,050
快 快 快
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

524
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,420
你还要乘3倍  你能做到的 让我看下…
And you do triple digits. You can do that. Let me see.

525
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:48,680
劳拉・罗丝琳 请跟我们走一趟
Laura Roslin? Come with us, please.

526
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,270
杀死泰罗尔的妻子只会使他反抗地更强烈
Killing Tyrol's wife will only embitter him against us.

527
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,190
他是工会主席
He's the head of a labor union, an organized faction...

528
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,100
拜托  莎伦.我们实话实说好了
Come on, Sharon, let's just be honest with one another.

529
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,110
其实在你看来  你不会考虑杀掉他们中的任何一个
In your view, you don't think there's any reason to kill anyone.

530
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,400
对吧?    是的  
Correct? Right.

531
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,150
我们做出的这个决定  我们所有人
Well, we made a decision, all of us,

532
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,070
就像我们刚到这里时
just like when we listened to you and Caprica Six

533
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,320
你和卡布里卡6号说的那样
when we came here to start this new and glorious chapter

534
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,700
掀开赛昂人与人类光辉的新篇章
in Cylon-human relations.

535
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,290
我们处决凯莉根本起不了什么作用
This has nothing to do with whether or not we execute Cally.

536
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,620
没人喜欢这个主意  布玛尔
No one enjoys the thought of mortal death, Boomer.

537
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,210
但她试图杀死你 也许这就是上帝的公正吧
But she tried to murder you. Maybe it's Gods' justice.

538
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,770
需要扶梯吗  副总统先生?
Need a lift, Mr. Vice President?

539
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,020
我想是的
I guess so.

540
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,490
最近没怎么看到你 很忙吗?
I haven't seen much of you lately. Been busy these days, huh?

541
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,950
还好  拘留室里没什么事可做
Well, not much to do in detention.

542
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,240
你被关了多久了?
How long have you been held?

543
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,160
我想大概四个月吧
Four months, I think.

544
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,160
我告诉过波塔尔我是不会与赛昂人合作的
I told Baltar I wouldn't have any part of collaborating with the Cylons,

545
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,580
然后他就愤怒了
and he got a little pissed.

546
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,040
他对我也有点不满
He's a little pissed at me, too.

547
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,180
跳跃完成 到达目标上方   好的 保持联系 伙计们
Jump complete. Right on target. Okay, hang on, guys.

548
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,470
我正下降到指定着陆点
We're dropping down to the landing point,

549
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,640
在前方有强干扰
and there's some heavy turbulence up ahead.

550
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,320
沿着河走 一定要贴近河岸
Follow the river. Make sure you hug the bank.

551
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
是 长官
MAN: Yes, sir.

552
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,550
好了  一旦我们到达指定地点 守在后面  并提供掩护
ATHENA: Okay, once we reach the rendezvous point, stay back and provide cover.

553
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,640
走吧
ATHENA: Go Panthers!

554
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,980
CBucks规则!
C- Bucks rule!

555
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,960
嗨  萨姆  好久不见
Hey, Sam, been a long time.

556
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,880
真有趣  我觉得每天都看见你似的
Funny, I... I feel like I see you every day.

557
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,180
来吧  我们走
Come on.

558
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,080
上帝啊  请别带走她
Lords, please don't take her life.

559
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,880
那是我的过错  不要惩罚她
It was my mistake. Don't punish her for it.

560
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,880
只是一次事故  卡拉  没什么了
It was an accident, Kara, nothing more.

561
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,600
凯西?
Kacey.

562
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:31,780
凯西  噢  我的天  宝贝
Kacey. Oh, my Gods. Honey.

563
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,940
让他们伸伸手脚吧
Let them stretch their legs for a minute.

564
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,320
是  长官
Yes, sir!

565
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,450
我们走  好了  所有人出来
Let's go! All right, everybody out!

566
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:20,490
5分钟休息  快点!  都出来
Five minute rest break! Come on, move! Everybody out!

567
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,290
5分钟休息  出发
Five minute rest break, max! Let's go!

568
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:27,290
来吧  5分钟  所有人出来
Come on, five minutes. Everyone out! Let's go!

569
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,130
告诉我事实  劳拉
Tell me something, Laura.

570
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,430
就在前面
MAN: Right up front!

571
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:44,600
去年那次 你想要窃取选举 是吗
Last year, you tried to steal an election, didn't you?

572
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,810
是的  我是这么做的  汤姆
Yes, I did, Tom.

573
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,240
真希望你当时能成功
I wish you'd gone through with it.

574
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,610
我也是
Me, too.

575
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,950
我们会等到黄昏才返回城市里去
SAM: We'll wait until nightfall before we go back to the city.

576
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,000
这里有一些下水道我们以前用过...
There's a system of tunnels we've been using. Our levels under...

577
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,750
嘘  你们听到了吗?
You hear that?

578
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,420
隐蔽
ATHENA: Down! Get down!

579
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,300
快 掩护
SAM: Move, take cover!

580
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,470
快!
Go, go, go!

581
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,890
你  过来这里
You, over here.

582
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:38,940
快跑 别回头 走
Run. Run, don't look back. Go!

583
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,790
快走
Let's go.
