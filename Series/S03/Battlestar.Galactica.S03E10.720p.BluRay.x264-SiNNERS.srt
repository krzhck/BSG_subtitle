1
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,100
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》 前情提要
KAT: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,440
我已心力交瘁
I was burnt out.

3
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,400
所以我就开始服用兴奋剂
I started taking stims.

4
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,610
这是什么?    兴奋剂
What are these? Stims.

5
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,200
看她的样子  已经吃了一把了
By the look of her, she's been taking them by the handful.

6
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,070
让我走 嗨 嗨
Let me go! Hey, hey!

7
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,700
你要知道  因为宿醉而简报迟到
You know, coming in late for a briefing 'cause you're hung over,

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,740
就已经很过分了
that's bad enough.

9
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,410
你还因此退出执行任务...
When you back out on a mission...

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,750
你听着  和你不同的是 我不会磕一把药之后
You see, unlike you, I don't take a bunch of pills,

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,340
还他妈的爬进驾驶舱 接着还他妈的着陆失败
and then climb in my cockpit so wired that I can't land the frakking ship.

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,720
星芭  你真是个耻辱
Starbuck, you're an embarrassment.

13
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,350
我想让你回到CIC
I need you back in the CIC.

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,640
没有你在那儿胁迫同僚
It just ain't the same without you in there,

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,060
就是不一样
intimidating the inmates.

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,480
噢  我可没有...
No, no.

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,900
只有12个赛昂人模型
There are only 12 Cylon models,

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,110
但在占领新卡布里卡的整个期间 只看到了7个
but in the entire occupation on New Caprica, I only saw seven.

19
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,480
另外的5个呢?
Who are the final five?

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,360
我不能说那个
I can't talk about that.

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,910
你知道她在说什么吗?
BALTAR: You have any idea what it's talking about?

22
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,410
绝大多数赛昂人都认为混合体的意识思维已经疯了
CAPRICA SIX: Most Cylons think the conscious mind of the Hybrid has simply gone mad

23
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,120
她所发出的声音对我们来说是无意义的
and the vocalizations we hear are meaningless.

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,000
但不是所有人都这么认为
But not everyone thinks that.

25
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,420
你要从你的日志中删除这个命令  执行命令
You'll delete the order from your logs. Execute.

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,630
没事了  没事了
It's okay, it's okay.

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,220
在生死之间
There is something beautiful,

28
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,850
有很瑰丽的景象
miraculous, between life and death.

29
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,000
你的意思是没有能食用的粮食可抢救了?
ROSLIN: You mean there's no food to be salvaged?

30
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,800
我们在这次意外污染发生前
What about the good food we had stored

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,300
储存的食物呢?
before we started inadvertently churning out the contaminated stuff?

32
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,810
新加工的受污染粮食直接进入了储藏系统
Well, the newly processed bad food went into the depleted storage system.

33
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,140
所有粮食都被污染了
Everything's tainted.

34
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,480
但是莎伦已经出发去寻找我们能加工的藻类了
But Sharon's out finding all this algae for us to process.

35
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,190
那东西很难吃  但基本上全是蛋白质
It's tough to choke down, but it's almost pure protein.

36
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:37,190
那如果莎伦回来报告说没有可以去那个星球的路怎么办?
What if Sharon comes back and reports there is no clear passage to this planet?

37
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,280
医生  那就有一个新问题了 我们还能撑多长时间?
Then the question is, Doc, how long can we survive?

38
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,740
按照我们现在的配给量 我觉得是7到10天
With the rations we've been on? I'd say seven to 10 days.

39
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,830
按计划  她什么时候回来?
ROSLIN: When is she due back?

40
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,790
她预期3小时前赶回
She was due three hours ago.

41
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,500
那里的辐射水平很高 但她很强壮  并且…
The radiation levels are high, but she's strong and she's...

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
她随时都可能赶回来的
She'll be here any moment.

43
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,750
抱歉  伙计们  我什么东西都没有 
No, I'm sorry, you guys, I don't have anything.

44
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,880
来分给大家?
To share?

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,500
我告诉过你了  星芭  我什么东西都没有  别烦我了
I told you, Starbuck, I don't have anything. Get off my back, okay?

46
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,050
是啊  我看到你的小床上有蛋白质棒的
Yeah, I saw a protein bar on your cot.

47
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,210
我把它给了科特尔         
I gave it to Cottle.

48
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,170
对呀!  就在我帮他解决之后
Right. Right after I gave him head.

49
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,470
你什么意思  我撒谎了?    哦 我不知道…
Oh, so, what, now I'm a liar? Oh, I don't know, if the shoe fits.

50
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,350
好了  好了  别吵!
All right, can it!

51
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,310
凯特  下来吧
Kat, get down here.

52
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,560
好了  他妈的  大家都吃吧
All right, for frak's sake, everybody, eat.

53
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,940
大家都被饿得变成妄想狂了
We're getting paranoid with this hunger.

54
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,120
这里  宝贝  吃这个
KAT: Here, baby, eat this.

55
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,960
我的天啊  真不错
Oh, my Gods, that's good.

56
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,180
去哪呢  戴安娜
BALTAR: Somewhere to be, D'Anna?

57
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,980
嘘  别把卡布里卡弄醒了
You'll wake Caprica.

58
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,030
听着  我情愿天天陪在你们俩身边
Look, I'd love to hang around with you two all day, but...

59
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,740
但是我还有些事要做
I have things to do.

60
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,870
我永远都不会明白你每天都独自干什么了
I'll never understand what you all do all day long,

61
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,750
像猫身上的跳蚤一样让人捉摸不定
living on this thing like fleas on a cat.

62
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,380
你认为她是去干什么了?
Where do you suppose she takes herself off to, then?

63
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,050
你不是第一个问这个问题的人了
You are not the only one asking that.

64
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,800
我不是?
I'm not?

65
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,340
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

66
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,260
她在忙着事呢
She's been doing things.

67
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,640
做事?
Doing things?

68
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,440
什么事?
What things?

69
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,730
好 动作快点
CREWMAN 1: Okay, let's make it faster.

70
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,450
抱歉 我扶住你了 中卫 小心
CREWMAN 2: Sorry about that. I've got you, Lieutenant. Watch your step.

71
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,870
走吧 我来拿头盔
Go ahead, I've got your helmet.

72
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,160
这边走 我来扶你 雅典娜
There you go. I've got you, Athena.

73
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,790
朝前走 让开路
Go ahead, walk her through.

74
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,420
百分之七浓度喷洒  移到右舷冲洗
Seven percent spray. Move around to the starboard side for wash-down.

75
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,550
二 十四
CREWMAN 3: Two-fourteen.

76
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,380
都好了 中尉 来这里 中尉
All the way down, Lieutenant. Right through here, Lieutenant.

77
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,430
来这儿
Right over here.

78
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,350
放射物已清除
Radiation negative.

79
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,850
别动
CREWMAN 4: Don't move!

80
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,310
有一条路穿过那个星团
There's a way through the star cluster.

81
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,650
我在另一边找到了那个星球
And I found the planet, on the other side.

82
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,440
我抓拍到了些照片
I skimmed it, I took photos.

83
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,950
正如我们所料  那里有很多海藻生长带
There's huge swaths of algae, just like we thought.

84
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
都变黑了
It's black.

85
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,280
她是赛昂人 她能承受那么大的辐射剂量
APOLLO: She's a Cylon. She can handle a radiation dose that big.

86
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,120
那只是我们觉得能!  谁去找下科特尔医生
We think. Someone call Cottle.

87
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,290
我很好
I'm fine.

88
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,790
对于你来说  也许是的
Maybe you are,

89
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,130
人类可能就做不到了
but a human might not be able to make it.

90
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,340
那现在我们怎么把数万人运过去?
So, then, how do we get tens of thousands of humans through there?

91
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,010
我们可以跳跃两次 在这个方位停一次
So we can make it through in two jumps with a stop right there.

92
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,800
是否可能只跳跃一次?
There's no solution with a single jump?

93
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,140
不行  这个星团太大了 都大到没法绕过去
No, the cluster's too big, and it's too big to go around, too.

94
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,060
但民用船只没有足够的装甲
But the civvie ships aren't shielded enough

95
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,310
跳跃到一个四周都是辐射的地方
to jump in the middle of all that radiation.

96
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,150
我觉得飞船上80%的人会因此而死掉
I would say 80% of the people on board would die.

97
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,980
我们能否只派卡拉狄加过去弄食物呢?
Can we send Galactica for food?

98
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,820
放在哪儿?  你什么意思?
And put it where? What do you mean?

99
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,320
那需要来回几十趟
It would take dozens of return trips.

100
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,320
每次离开 整个舰队就毫无防御能力
Each time we'd leave the fleet vulnerable to attack.

101
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,660
我们不能用把食物带给大家
We just can't bring the food to the people.

102
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,120
那假如我们把大家带去找食物呢?
What if we bring the people to the food?

103
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,910
把人们送上卡拉狄加
Put the people on Galactica.

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,830
把只配备基本船员的民用船只派过去
Send the civilian ships with skeleton crew,

105
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,040
给他们配备防辐射装束
give them radiation meds.

106
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,670
除非辐射不会把民用船只的导航系统烧坏
Except that the radiation would fry the civvie ships' nav systems.

107
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,130
那样他们在雷达上什么都看不到
They wouldn't be able to see squat on dradis.

108
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,510
他们如果进去了  想跳出来都难
There wouldn't even be a way to calculate a jump out.

109
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,010
比那还更糟
It's worse than that.

110
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,010
一旦你跳跃进去  能见度很低  你只能在那里漂泊
Once you jump in, the light is so blinding you begin to drift.

111
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,270
在找到坐标前  你在那早完蛋了
And before you can get your bearings, you're over there.

112
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,640
没有可视度 辐射还会让仪表失灵
APOLLO: No visual contact, instruments blinded by radiation.

113
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,150
他们会迷路的.他们肯定会被烧掉
They'd get lost, they'd burn up.

114
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,780
领航船
Pilot ship.

115
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,910
我们给每艘民用船只配备一架猛禽机
We pair a Raptor with each civilian ship.

116
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,870
猛禽机的导航系统抗辐射性要好一些
APOLLO: The Raptor navigation systems are hardened against nuclear strikes.

117
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,540
他们能承受得了这种辐射
They could handle the radiation.

118
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,710
每架猛禽机能领航一艘民用船只通过星团
Each Raptor could lead a civilian ship through the cluster,

119
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,880
然后他们再一起跳跃出去
then they both jump out together.

120
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,880
问题是要跳跃多少次?
The question is, how many jumps will it take?

121
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,680
来回共跳跃5次
APOLLO: Five round trips.

122
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,350
你们听到了吧 往返跳跃5次
You heard. Five round trips.

123
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,970
在我们跳过去的时候
On our outbound jumps,

124
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,270
我们每架猛禽机都负责向民用船只传送
we'll each be responsible for relaying jump coordinates

125
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,770
下一个跳跃点坐标
to our own specific civilian ship,

126
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,230
确保他们跳跃点的准确 并且要确保他们不离队
nailing them to their jump points and ensuring they don't drift off.

127
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,400
长官  当我们到那里时  要不要吃东西
Sir, are we gonna get fed when we get there?

128
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,530
最后嘛  当然要 但是要在我们找到并开始处理藻类后
Eventually, yes, but only after we find the algae and get it processed.

129
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,410
事实上  
But the truth is that

130
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,620
辐射后的呕吐反应会让大家倒胃口
nausea from the radiation exposure will take care of our appetites.

131
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,920
你们都会被配发辐射剂量牌来跟踪你们受到的辐射量
You'll all be issued with radiation badges to track our exposure.

132
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,920
白色的  像这样的就没事
White, like this, you're okay.

133
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,420
当你暴露在辐射下时间越长  它就越黑
As your exposure increases, it'll darken.

134
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,920
当它变成这样了  那么你们就挂了
If it approaches this, then you'll be pulled from duty.

135
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,590
记住要随时观察剂量牌
Keep checking your badges.

136
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,430
这是每一个机师各自的责任 必须检查自己的剂量牌
It's every pilot's own responsibility to monitor their own badge.

137
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,760
星芭
Starbuck.

138
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,100
记住  这次任务我们全都独立飞行
Remember, we're all flying solo on this mission.

139
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,480
那就意味着  在你累了  或者
So that means there'll be nobody there to bitch-slap you

140
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,770
在你的机翼旁看到赛昂人时 没人能跟你配合搭档
if you start to get tired or start seeing little toasters on your wing.

141
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,730
我们会派发兴奋剂  到时候就用它
We'll be issuing stims, so use them.

142
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,780
什么?你疯了吗? 我们不能用兴奋剂
What? Are you crazy? We can't use stims.

143
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,820
凯特  你有什么疑问吗?
Kat, do you have a problem?

144
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,200
兴奋剂会加快我们的新陈代谢 很快会耗光我们的体力
Stims amp up your metabolism. We've got nothing to burn.

145
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,120
你让我们使用兴奋剂  我们会飞到民用船只里去的
You put stims in our systems, we're gonna be flying into the sides of the ships.

146
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,290
是真的吗?会让我们变得那么糟?
Is that true? They'd mess us up?

147
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,870
你过去喜欢用兴奋剂的  凯特
You used to like the stims, Kat.

148
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,910
好啦  那是对兴奋剂的个别看法
All right, personal discretion on the stims.

149
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,580
我们现在准备如刚才所说让第一波平民上船
We're taking the first load of civilians onboard as we speak.

150
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,090
就到这里 4小时以内开始
That's it. Skids up in four hours.

151
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,550
这里没有食物
DUALLA: There is no food here.

152
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,350
这艘船没有食品配给了
There are no rations anywhere on this ship.

153
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,480
如果有谁跟你们说哪里有食物  那是他们在骗你们
If someone told you there was food, they were lying.

154
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,310
如果你们离开这个区域  我们就会使用强制措施
If you leave this area, force will be used.

155
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,150
当我们通过星团
Once we get through the star cluster,

156
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,730
你们就可以返回原来所在的飞船
you will all be returned to your designated ships.

157
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,570
萨沙
Sasha.

158
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,000
跟上 直走向下到前面 对了
CREWMAN: Keep following, straight down to the front. That's right.

159
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,750
我不叫萨沙
My name isn't Sasha.

160
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,500
我是劳安・凯特瑞恩上尉 懂了吗?
My name is Captain Louanne Katraine, you understand me?

161
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,130
萨沙和你是上辈子的事情
Sasha and you were a lifetime ago.

162
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,380
好的 好的  就因为你现在有了杠杠了  对吗?
Right, right, 'cause you got this now, right?

163
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,350
不会再被罪人连累了  对吗?
No more hanging with the sinners, huh?

164
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,400
离我远点 你听懂了吗?
Stay away from me. Do you understand me?

165
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,190
他们知道你是什么样的人吗?
They even know who you really are?

166
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,660
噢  真巧在这里碰到你了
Oh, fancy bumping into you here.

167
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,210
你能相信我又迷路了吗?
Can you believe I'm lost again?

168
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,330
在这种地方我永远都找不到路
I never find my way around this place.

169
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,540
你到哪去了?
Where have you been?

170
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,210
我在和西蒙讨论去地球的下一步该怎么走
I've been talking with Simon about our next move toward Earth.

171
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,760
这个问题很明显有些争论
There's some debate about it, apparently.

172
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,260
当然了  如果我去问那个西蒙
Of course, if I spoke to the relevant Simon,

173
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,010
他能确认是你参加了这个会议的吗?
he'll actually ascertain you were at this meeting?

174
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,220
对不起  请再说一遍?
Beg your pardon?

175
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,640
我听说是你自己独自离开后 一人做事的
I hear that you've been going off by yourself, doing things.

176
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,020
真的吗?
Really?

177
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,360
那么  是谁告诉你关于我的事的呢?
Now who would tell you anything about my business?

178
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,440
那是真的了
So it's true?

179
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,570
卡布里卡?
Caprica?

180
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:30,450
你知不知道自己头发里有些干了的粘物?
Did you know you have some dried goo in your hair?

181
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,210
那是你复活时候出现的吧
That can happen when you resurrect.

182
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,420
你知道吗  现在我开始明白
Yeah, now I'm beginning to understand

183
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,040
这些天的下午  你对自己做了什么
just what you've been doing with yourself on all these afternoons.

184
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,300
你根本不了解你在指责我什么?
Do you have any idea what you are accusing me of?

185
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
当然知道
Yes.

186
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,050
故意的一次次的自杀
Intentionally killing yourself over and over

187
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,220
这样你就可以一次又一次地复活
so you can download over and over.

188
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,230
但死亡只像扇旋转门  对吧?
But that's just a revolving door, isn't it?

189
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,940
过来!
KAT: Come here!

190
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,780
你想干吗?
What do you want?

191
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,580
别紧张  宝贝  放松
Take it down a notch, baby. Relax.

192
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,740
我不是在寻找生意伙伴
I'm looking for a business partner.

193
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,790
我说过你他妈的离我远点
I told you to stay the frak away from me.

194
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,080
是啊  因为如果他们知道你的过去
Yeah, 'cause if they find out who you really are,

195
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,790
他们就会把你开除  甚至更糟
they'll kick you out of the service? Or worse?

196
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,960
现在  你是不是以为我想那么做?
Now, do you think I want that?

197
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,010
我不会那么做的  因为那样做了
I don't want that, 'cause if that happens,

198
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,630
谁来养我呢?
who's gonna feed me?

199
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,970
噢  拜托  你搞到了三支  你以为我不知道吗?
Oh, come on, you're getting three squares. You think I don't know that?

200
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,140
我们没有  我也没有隐瞒任何东西 恩佐 
We don't. And I don't have anything stashed, Enzo.

201
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,060
是啊  你是没有
Yeah, sure, you don't.

202
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,020
噢  让我们重头开始吧  宝贝
Oh, we go back, baby.

203
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,570
什么时候照顾你也是犯法的了?
Since when is it a crime to take care of your own?

204
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,700
记住  我知道你是谁  我还知道怎么让你快乐
Remember, I know who you are, and I know how to make you happy.

205
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,660
把你的爪子拿开
Get your hands off of me.

206
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,930
上校!
Colonel.

207
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,020
继续
Go ahead.

208
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,330
检查一下
Check it out.

209
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,180
好的       欢迎回来  长官
MAN 1: All right. MAN 2: Welcome back, sir.

210
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,260
欢迎回来  长官    很高兴见到你 长官
MAN 3: Welcome back, sir. WOMAN 1: Good to see you, sir.

211
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,480
欢迎 很高兴见到你 长官 欢迎  长官
Welcome. It's good to see you, sir. Welcome, sir.

212
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,850
上校    很高心见到你 上校
Colonel. MAN 4: Good to see you, Colonel.

213
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,270
对 就这样    很高兴你回来
HOSHI: Yeah. That's it. WOMAN 2: Good to have you back.

214
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,650
好了
MAN 5: All right.

215
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
我们跟你了 长官
We're with you, sir.

216
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,730
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

217
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,280
够了 你们这些家伙都没事做吗?
Enough! Don't you people have jobs to do?

218
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,370
欢迎回来  上校  
Welcome back, Colonel.

219
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,490
上将
Admiral.

220
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,670
阿波罗  这是卡拉狄加  命令你发射猛禽机
Apollo, Galactica. Launch Raptors on your orders.

221
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,396
牧羊犬们  找到你要看管的"小羊羔" 
APOLLO ON RADIO: Shepherds, find your sheep, 

222
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:29,670
跟近点 别把他们弄丢了
stay close and never let them go.

223
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,880
这些家伙还要靠我们通过这段路呢
These crews are counting on us to guide them through.

224
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,430
阿波罗 星芭 抵达指定位置
STARBUCK: Apollo, Starbuck on station.

225
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,300
我看到Chiron号了
KAT ON RADIO: I've got visual on Chiron.

226
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,310
热狗 看到Adriatic号了
HOTDOG: Hotdog. Adriatic in sight.

227
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,600
好的
Okay.

228
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,930
当跳跃进星云以后 你们会分不清方向
When you jump into the cluster, you will be disoriented.

229
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,640
记住首先要做的
Take it one step at a time.

230
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,697
就是找到你们要带的民用船 
Find your sheep, work the jump 

231
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:47,270
然后计算下个跳跃点  把他们带出来
calculations and get them out.

232
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,320
记住  我们不能待到受最大辐射剂量的时候
Remember, we do not stay beyond our radiation dose limit.

233
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,870
阿波罗报告飞行员已准备好  长官
GAETA: Apollo reports pilots in position, sir.

234
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,030
命令他开始跳跃
Initiate jump on his command.

235
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,200
卡拉狄加会跟上
Galactica will follow.

236
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,410
是  长官
GAETA: Aye, aye, sir.

237
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,750
猛禽机  我是阿波罗  听我口令跳跃
Raptors, Apollo. We jump on my mark.

238
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,050
三
Three.

239
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,300
二  跳跃
Two. Jumping.

240
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,470
一...开始
One. Mark.

241
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,860
喔!这是什么?  我什么都看不到
Whoa! What is this? I can't see anything.

242
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,780
妈的
Frak.

243
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,470
找到你了!
Got you!

244
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,680
凯特  你找到你的了吗?
Kat, you got yours?

245
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,180
是的 阿波罗
KAT: Affirmative, Apollo.

246
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,140
只看到了Chrion号  传送坐标中
Only got eyes for the Chiron. Relaying coordinates.

247
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,020
飞行编队 我是阿波罗 我跟上了Thera Sita号了
Squadron, Apollo. I have Thera Sita.

248
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,310
马上给她传送坐标
Relaying jump coordinates to her right now.

249
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,610
阿波罗 我是星芭 我跟上我那艘了
STARBUCK: Apollo, Starbuck. I got mine.

250
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,360
妈的  我就在这地方干等着
Frak. I'm just barely holding on here.

251
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,660
我跟丢了 谁看见Adriatic号了?  他们没跳到预定坐标
I lost mine. Did anyone see the Adriatic? She has lost her jump coordinates.

252
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,740
热狗 无信号
APOLLO: Hotdog, negative.

253
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,410
无信号  热狗  没有Adriatic号的信号
Negative, Hotdog. Negative on Adriatic.

254
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,830
热狗  猛禽需要放松点控制
Hotdog, the Raptor needs to be under control, man.

255
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,290
放松点操作 这不是蝮蛇
Ease up with the stick. This is not a Viper, it's a Raptor.

256
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,460
妈的  妈的!
Frak it, frak it!

257
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,460
伙计 你能找到的 用眼睛去找
APOLLO: Find her, man! Get a visual!

258
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,930
阿波罗  这里是卡拉狄加
Apollo, it's Galactica Actual.

259
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,890
你们已达辐射剂量上限 必须跳跃走
You've reached your radiation dose limit. You've got to jump.

260
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,980
我们倒计时!      收到 卡拉狄加
Count us down. APOLLO: Roger that, Galactica.

261
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,520
不  阿波罗 请等下
No! No, Apollo, please, wait!

262
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,980
热狗  听我的  我们现在必须离开这儿
Hotdog, listen to me! We have to get out of here, now!

263
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,900
我能找到他们!    我能找到他们!  等等 
I know I can find them! I can find them! Hold on!

264
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,110
请等等 不！    星芭  跟我倒计时一起跳跃  
Please wait! No! Starbuck, jump on my mark.

265
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,650
不管是否找到飞船
With or without your ships!

266
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,410
请等等         1  2  3... 
Please! One, two, three.

267
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,370
不  请等等!!      跳跃
No! Please! Wait! Mark!

268
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,750
我们不能这样离开他们!
We can't leave without her!

269
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,000
他妈的!他妈的!
Frak! Frak!

270
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,720
跳跃完成
Jump complete.

271
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,260
雷达恢复上线 报告舰壳中度损伤
Dradis is back online. Ship reports moderate hull damage.

272
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,060
卡拉狄加 阿波罗 第一波完成
APOLLO: Galactica, Apollo. First trip complete.

273
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,270
猛禽机降落  
Raptors, land your birds,

274
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,060
并准备跳跃回来护送第二波民用船只
and prepare to jump back for the second group of civilians.

275
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,360
我们弄丢了Adriatic号
We lost the Adriatic.

276
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,320
这只是我们的第一波
It's only our first jump.

277
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,740
是  是啊
Yes, it is.

278
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,800
Carina号  我是凯特!  报告你的方位
Carina, Kat! Report your location!

279
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,600
凯特  阿波罗 你跟上Carina号了吗?
Kat, Apollo. Do you have the Carina?

280
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,140
没有!  辐射影响了我的导航!
Negative! Radiation's pissing on my nav.

281
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,560
我看不到
I can't see frak!

282
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,280
好吧 去找到她
Okay. Found her!

283
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,330
不 妈的     凯特！
No! Frak! APOLLO: Kat!

284
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,040
凯特  报告情况!
Kat, report!

285
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,540
真是该死的!
Gods damn it!

286
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,290
好了   凯特  时间到了 我们跳跃 听我口令
All right, Kat, Apollo! Time's up! We're jumping on my mark!

287
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,540
倒计时 3 2 1 开始!  没有Carina号!
Three, two, one, mark! Not without the Carina!

288
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,760
我跟丢了
I lost her.

289
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,300
我跟丢了
I lost her.

290
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,340
好了  我们再次成功地让八艘船过去了
APOLLO: All right. We managed to get another eight ships through.

291
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,670
但是我们也弄丢了一艘
But we still lost one.

292
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,680
我们赶"羊"的技术是越来越好了
We've got to get better at tracking our sheep.

293
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,310
在跳跃的时候反应得很快
Quicker reaction times out of the jumps.

294
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,940
赛道别向不该发的船发送坐标
Racetrack, don't be calling out coordinates to the wrong ship.

295
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,110
我搞混了
I got mixed up.

296
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,070
检查你们的装备  检查完再检查
Keep checking your instruments and recheck them.

297
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,190
那些设备没点用
The instruments are crap.

298
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,370
好了
All right.

299
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,040
这就是第四次护送任务的总结了
That concludes Outbound Four.

300
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,420
现在是第四次休息了 一个个走
This is Return Four. One to go.

301
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,380
好了  休息一会
All right, get some rest.

302
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,800
来吧
Come on.

303
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,600
这是医生那来的报告
Here's a report from the Doc.

304
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,480
上百名陆战队员太虚弱无法工作
A hundred Marines too weak to work.

305
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,070
200多名等着打点滴
Two hundred more are ready to drop.

306
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,490
这是可以阻缓饥饿的
That's gonna slow down the harvest.

307
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,280
刚才这批平民看来搞出不少麻烦
The last batch of passengers kicked up some trouble.

308
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,330
你把这些家伙带到那一边
You get these people to the other side

309
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,960
他们想着会有做好的饭等着他们去吃
and they think there's a diner and a chef waiting to take their order.

310
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,380
我知道
I know.

311
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,590
他们何时才学会得到就必须要付出呢?
They got to learn we got to process the thing first, for frak's sake.

312
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,010
告诉他们这些话  让他们把自己肚子勒紧点
Try telling that to a bunch of empty stomachs.

313
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,800
我听说他们还在吃纸 是不是这样?
I hear they're still eating paper. Is that true?

314
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,180
不 纸张也短缺
No. Paper shortage.

315
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,960
不是个好消息!
Not a good sign.

316
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,090
的确不是  长官
No, sir.

317
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,620
当你重生的时候 你看到其余五名赛昂人的脸了吗?
So while you resurrect, do you see the faces of the Final Five?

318
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,080
没人见过他们
The ones that no one's seen?

319
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,960
你为什么对他们感兴趣?
Why do you want to know about them?

320
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,840
我可能是个赛昂人
I could be a Cylon.

321
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,840
我可能不再是那帮人的叛徒
I would stop being a traitor to one set of people

322
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,220
而是另一帮人的英雄
and be a hero to another,

323
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,020
并且有一个归属的地方
and have a place to belong.

324
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,610
你可以帮我了解我的使命
You would help me understand my destiny.

325
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,700
你看到我的脸了吗?
Have you seen my face?

326
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,860
你的脸?
Your face?

327
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,370
是  我的脸
Yes, my face.

328
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,450
我不记得了
I can't remember.

329
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,460
当我脑子还清楚记得的时候我试图把他们都画到纸上  
I've been trying to get it all down on paper while it's still fresh in my mind,

330
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,340
但是总无法记得比这些更多的
but nothing much comes out.

331
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,380
我记得的都是些垃圾  我无法记住....
It's rubbish. I can't remember.

332
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,760
是赛昂人  还是人类
Cylons, humans...

333
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,900
是我们在探索我们是谁?
We're all just trying to discover who we are.

334
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,400
不是吗?
Aren't we?

335
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,000
嘿  恩佐
Okay. Hey, Enzo.

336
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,670
是的
Yeah?

337
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,720
我冒用了劳安・凯特瑞恩这个女孩的名字
I took the name Louanne Katraine from a girl

338
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,930
她在卡布里卡受袭两天前就死了
who died two days before the attack on Caprica.

339
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,600
这让我通过了背景调查
It got me through the background checks.

340
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,150
是啊  当时确实不容易  继续讲
Yeah, times were rough. Keep going.

341
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,530
我是个毒贩
I was a drug runner.

342
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,370
恩佐是我的上家
Enzo was my supplier.

343
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,830
你想干什么?  我们是贩毒的  行了吗?
What do you want? We were truckers, okay?

344
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,750
我们只是跑腿的
We just moved stuff.

345
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,670
民众
People.

346
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,470
你知道的  某些人以为那是赛昂人渗透进卡布里卡的方法
You see, some think that, that's the way that the Cylons infiltrated Caprica.

347
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,010
他们像种子一样撒遍整个殖民地外围地区
They seeded themselves throughout the outer colonies,

348
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,720
然后通过犯罪进入首都
and then they used criminals to get them into the capital.

349
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,480
不论是谁被发现帮助了赛昂人都会被认为是叛国者
Anyone who's found guilty of helping the Cylons is considered a traitor.

350
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,860
我们没有带赛昂人 你怎么知道没有呢?
We didn't carry Cylons. How do you know?

351
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,240
因为没人知道他们长得像我们
Because nobody knew that they looked like us.

352
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,490
那你怎么知道你没带过呢?
Then how do you know you didn't?

353
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,040
你怎么知道呢?
How do you know?

354
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,500
你认为我是个叛国者
You think I'm a traitor?

355
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,330
我认为我是个叛国者?
You think I'm a traitor?

356
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,630
不 我不认为你是个叛国者
No. I don't think you're a traitor.

357
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,340
你是个聪明的年轻女人
You're a smart young woman.

358
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,560
那是老头子说的
That's what the old man said.

359
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,350
你只是没有聪明到面对真正的自我
You're just not smart enough to accept who you are.

360
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:55,190
你看  你通过欺骗的方法进入了我们这个好人帮
You see, you lied your way into the company of good people.

361
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,370
星芭  不要告诉上将
Starbuck, don't tell the Admiral.

362
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,450
求你
Please.

363
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,750
不要告诉他  否则我…    否则什么?
Please don't, or I... Or what?

364
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,790
星芭  请让我自己告诉他
Please. Just let me tell him myself.

365
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,920
请让我自己说
Please, just let me.

366
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,510
这样你同意吗?
Can you do that?

367
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
老天
Gods.

一度 名义角度

371
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,640
进化让他们不再恐惧
lons of evolution have buried their fuse.

372
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,480
你就是在这里找到灵感?  不断地进行复活
So, this is where you got the idea to start intentionally downloading?

373

374
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,650
好  让我们看看能找到什么
All right, let's see what we can find out.

375
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,360
历史上  人和机器的联结
HYBRID: Throughout history, the nexus between man and machine

has spawned some of the most dramatic and compelling...

377
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,830
盖尤斯 你知道你在干什么吗?
Gaius, what do you think you're doing?

378
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,630
别碰它!
Don't touch it.

379
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,310

380
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,270
想火一样燃烧的思想

381
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,020
是的  我在

382
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,690
找到光芒旁的那只手

在母兽夫君的眼睛中

你还好吗?
You all right?

385
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,130
她只说些胡话  不是吗?
It just speaks nonsense, doesn't it?

386
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,340
我不认为她说的是胡话

眼睛的丈夫 那眼睛是

那是古代神书上的东西

394
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,200
天呀
My God.

395
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,000
会不会在他们的神和我们的神之间有什么联系?
Could there be a connection between their Gods and ours?

396
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,000
那意味着什么?
What does it mean?

397
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,380
那是个方位
It's a location.

398
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,510
一颗隐藏于光芒中的行星 
A planet hidden in the shadow of light.

399
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,130
可能是在一堆星团中
Probably a cluster of stars.

400
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,600
那会指引我们找到朱庇特之眼
That will lead us to the Eye of Jupiter.

401
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,400
并找到藏在光芒中的那只手
As to the hand hidden in the shadow of light,

402
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,770
可能是某种神器

403
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
手
Hand.

404
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,320
有五个手指

405
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,580
代表五张面孔
Five faces.

406
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,960
现在我们需要做的就是找到那颗正确的行星
Now all we have to do is find the right planet.

407
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,220
在一个星团里
The right star cluster.

408
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,400
起来面对真正的自我
Accept who you are.

409
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,110
起来面对真正的自我
Accept who you are.

410
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,200
起来面对真正的自我
Accept who you are.

411
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,750
对

还记得我吗？
You remember me?

413
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,250
没错
Yeah.

414
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,840
没错  我当然记得你
Yeah, I remember you.

415
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,050
狗娘养的杂种
Thieving bastard.

416
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,510
你会毁了我的一切
You'll ruin everything I've got.

417
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,100
靠近我
Come here.

418
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,920

Jump spot's become unstable. We've gotta get out of here.

430

所有人听我的命令实施跳跃
Everyone, jump on my mark.

437
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,880
我不能再带丢另一艘飞船

3  2  1  实施跳跃!
Three, two, one. Mark!

439
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,360
阿波罗 星芭 我没看见凯特

是凯特的
GAETA: It's Kat.

443
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,430

凯特把Faru Sadin号带回来了

450
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,340
卡拉狄卡  我是凯特

他们说你想见我
They said you wanted to see me.

453
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,370
对
Yeah.

454
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,080
我觉得我们之间不应该象上次那样结束
I don't think we should end the way we ended.

455
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,000
听着  嗯
Listen.

456
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,790
每个人都...
Everybody is...

457
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,380
每个人都在被自己曾经的过错所折磨
Everybody is stuck with the things that they're not proud of.

458
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,520
那个  嗯  我的那个关于所谓好人的说法
And that... That thing about good people, I...

459
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,520
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean that.

460
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,610
我知道
Yeah, I know.

461
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
给你
Here.

462
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,200
拿着  这是安眠药
Take these. Sleeping pills.

463
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,790
这些已经足够了
Enough.

464
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,880
你想了断的话就用它吧
So, take them if you want.

465
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,840
谢谢
Thank you.

466
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,380
我得走了
I got to go.

467
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,110
上将  我...
Admiral, I...

468
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,070
我违背了您的命令  对不起
I know. I'm sorry.

469
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,570
我不是来这儿说教的
I'm not here to lecture.

470
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,040
我是来为你晋级的
I'm letting you know about a promotion.

471
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,750
我现在重新晋升你为CAG(空军指挥官)
I'm making you CAG again.

472
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,920
长官  你知道我是不会痊愈了的  对吗?
Sir, you know I'm not getting out of here, right?

473
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,380
它是你用实际行动赢得的
But you earned it.

474
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,800
你所做到的比面对枪林弹雨还要困难
What you did was harder than facing a bullet,

475
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:17,020
而你却为了拯救其他人的生命毫不犹豫地去做
and you did it without putting one other soul in harm's way.

476
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,560
如果换成是我  我都不知道自己能不能做到
I don't know if I could've done that.

477
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,360
我真的希望能够给予你更高的奖赏和鼓励
I wish there was something more that I could give you.

478
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,940
不 这足够好了
No. It's good.

479
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,780
我非常愿意成为CAG
I would like to be a CAG very much.

480
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,450
谢谢你
Thank you.

481
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,750
有件事情
There's a thing...

482
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,590
可能会让你后悔刚才的决定
A reason why you might not want to do this.

483
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,390
卡拉知道这件事
Kara knows what it is,

484
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,060
但我想亲自告诉你
but I wanted to tell you myself.

485
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,360
除了我已经知道的 我不想再知道更多了
I don't need to know anything other than what I already know.

486
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,610
当初你还是CAG的时候
When you were CAG,

487
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,610
你尽力保护你的队员
you protected your people,

488
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,160
你让他们感觉到安全进而英勇无畏
made them feel safe enough to be brave.

489
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,870
你刚才想要说的能改变你所做出的杰出贡献吗？
What you were gonna say doesn't change that.

490
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,430
你...你不走吗？
Are you... Are you staying?

491
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,190
嗯  我留下来陪你
Oh, I'm staying.

492
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,320
某种程度上我喜欢这间病房
I love this sick bay, in a way.

493
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,280
会让我想起我儿子Zak出生的地方
It reminds me of where my son, Zak, was born.

494
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,660
卡罗安妮当时是那么的高兴
Carolanne was so happy.

495
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,920
她以为
She was convinced,

496
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,710
两次怀的都是女孩
both times, that she was having a girl.

497
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,010
所以最后都是非常的惊喜
So it was a surprise at the end.

498
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,930
你也想要个女儿吗？
Did you want a girl, too?

499
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,350
是啊
Yeah.

500
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,850
三是个吉利的数字
Three's a good round number.
