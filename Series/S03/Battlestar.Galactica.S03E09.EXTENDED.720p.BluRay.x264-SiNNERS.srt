1
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,760
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》 前情提要
APOLLO: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,390
我感觉我在放弃我的职责
I feel like I'm abandoning my post.

3
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,970
是时候打包了  少  你明白我的意思
It's time to pack it in, Saul. You know it.

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,980
超过半数的船员下去新卡布里卡了
TIGH: More than half the crew's down on New Caprica already.

5
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,400
这里真的没有太多东西需要我做了
I'm not really doing too much up here anymore.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,940
祝你好运
Good luck.

7
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,990
噢  天呀  是赛昂舰队!  他们发现我们了
Oh, my Gods. It's the Cylon Fleet. They found us.

8
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,570
你们也该知道这次任务只能以一种方式结束
There's only one way that this mission ends,

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,080
那就是从新卡布里卡
and that's with the successful rescue

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,500
成功营救我们的人民
of our people off of New Caprica.

11
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,040
你把他们都带回来了  少
You brought them home, Saul.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,130
不是所有人
Not all of them.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,460
我们怎么办?
What about us?

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,000
不会再有我们两个字了  行不?
There is no "us," all right?

15
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,010
这里已经什么都没有了
There is nothing here.

16
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,630
你明白没有?  什么都没有
Do you get that? Nothing!

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,100
李  你准备何时给自己找个女友?
Lee, when are you gonna get yourself a girl?

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,100
我会的  谢谢
I'm doing fine, thank you.

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,180
你还是没和小杜搞上  对吗?
You're not still frakking Dualla, are you?

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,310
我以与你共事为荣  中尉
I am proud to serve with you, Lieutenant,

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,860
也以你为我的妻子为荣
and to call you my wife.

22
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,980
我现在处在不同的立场
STARBUCK: I'm in a different place now.

23
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,530
我只想狠扁一个人 而那人最好是你
I just want to hurt someone, and it might as well be you.

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,420
上将?
DUALLA: Admiral?

25
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,920
上将?
Admiral?

26
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,470
长官 工程师需要更多的时间再次升级导航系统
Sir, Engineering is requesting more time for the nav upgrade again.

27
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,890
维护系统 飞行系统 武器系统  
Maintenance, flight ops, weapons.

28
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,850
到处都是乱糟糟的 一堆事都没按时完成
We're seeing botched drills, missed deadlines across the board.

29
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,680
与此同时 一半机组人员都在船舱里
Meanwhile, half the crew's belowdecks.

30
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,940
你是想说这一场景不对劲吧?
Are you telling me something's wrong with this picture?

31
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,770
长官 我建议取消今晚的活动
Sir, I suggest we cancel tonight.

32
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,610
让所有人都回到岗位上
Call everyone back to duty.

33
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,900
不 不
No, no.

34
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,740
他们需要这个 或许我们都需要
The crew needs this. Maybe we all need it.

35
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,370
稍微放松一下再专心工作
Adjust our heads a little bit, refocus.

36
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,080
你也是 小杜 把工作放一放
You do, too, Dee. Go put your tags in.

37
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,700
我们会补回来的
We'll catch up.

38
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,830
是 长官
Sir.

39
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,070
这正是我想要的
That was exactly what I needed.

40
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,880
很高兴我的服务能让您满意
Glad to be of service.

41
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,590
他们让你什么时候回卡布里卡?
When do they need you back on the Caprica?

42
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,510
为什么 已经想要我死了?
Why? Itching to get rid of me already?

43
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,260
我是这个意思吗?
Did I say anything like that?

44
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,840
当然不是
You didn't have to.

45
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,680
山姆 这是我现在能做的一切了
Look, Sam, this is pretty much all that I can handle right now.

46
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,150
该死的
Damn it.

47
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,360
找这个吗?
Looking for this?

48
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,280
是的
Yeah.

49
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,990
卡拉  
Kara,

50
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,330
我知道你经历了一场噩梦 我也能体谅
I know you went through hell on that rock and I was very patient.

51
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,410
我想要你做个真正的你
But I want you back.

52
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,880
我想要我们的婚姻回来 我的意思是真正的婚姻
I want our marriage back, I want a real marriage.

53
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,220
那如果我还没有准备好去面对呢?
And what if I'm just not ready for that?

54
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,970
我不知道 那我猜你可能永远做不到的
I don't know, then I guess it'll never be.

55
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,400
也许  毕竟我不是你真正要的人
Maybe 'cause I'm not what you really want after all.

56
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,910
如果这是你的真实想法
If that's how you really feel,

57
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,330
我不会试图改变它
I'm not gonna try and change your mind.

58
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,540
不会
I'm not.

59
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,300
我舞会迟到了
I'm late for the dance.

60
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,360
别忘了你靠在门口的靴子  山米
Don't forget your boots on the way out, Sammy.

61
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,160
你行的   李!   加油
KAT: You can fight them, Lee, come on!

62
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,530
看不出阿格森很能打嘛
If it isn't the fighting Agathon.

63
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,200
星芭  你又和往常一样迟到
Starbuck, late to the party as usual.

64
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,210
至少我及时看到你教训空军指挥官了
At least I got here in time to watch you kick the CAG's ass.

65
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,380
打得不错 小心右路
KAT: You got it, slick him right up.

66
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,170
他打得很凶  我会利用这点
He's a tough little frakker, I'll give him that.

67
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,510
他在戏弄我 似乎以为胜券在握
He's playing me like he's got it in for me.

68
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,920
知道吗 那是他的弱点
STARBUCK: You know what? That's his weakness.

69
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,720
当他出击时 他的右路有空档
When he charges in, he drops his right.

70
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,300
好了  开始
Okay? Okay. All right.

71
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,020
你行的 卡尔 加油
You can do this, Karl. Come on.

72
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,660
不错  几个月以前
Not bad. Couple of months ago,

73
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,240
你根本没法叫他上拳击台的
you would've had to roll him into this ring.

74
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,870
对 不再如此了
Well, not anymore.

75
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,370
如果头脑冷静的话 他还有机会
You know, with a cooler head, he might have had a chance.

76
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,030
加油
Come on!

77
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
一…
TIGH: One,

78
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,610
二…
two,

79
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
三…
three,

80
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
四…
four,

81
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,110
五…
five,

82
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,530
六…
six,

83
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,040
七
seven.

84
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,080
嘿  嘿  好了 看着我
Hey, hey, hey. All right, look at me.

85
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,980
你赢了 宝贝
You did it, baby.

86
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,900
费希尔 费希尔 你上了
Fischer. Fischer, you're up.

87
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,530
打得不错
You did fine.

88
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,280
被这样打就让你吃不消了  对吧?
Bit off a little more than you could chew, huh?

89
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,210
噢  拜托  李  别那样
Come on, Lee. Don't be that way.

90
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,040
别走啊 晚会才开始
Stick around, the night's young.

91
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,380
哦 那你玩好 我得失陪了
Well, I guess then you'll just have to enjoy it without me.

92
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,640
你干嘛不跟安德斯来
Why don't you track down Anders?

93
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,680
他总是笑容可掬
He's always good for a laugh.

94
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,320
哦 甜蜜的麻烦
Oh, trouble in paradise.

95
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,410
为什么我一点也不觉得奇怪呢
Now why doesn't that surprise me?

96
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,780
或许你已经发现我们在同一个兵营里
Yeah, well, maybe if you had found us both a billet

97
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,910
我们没在不同的船上
we wouldn't be living on different ships, huh?

98
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,080
我不相信
I don't believe this.

99
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,250
你在为了你该死的婚姻责备我吗?
You're blaming me for your frakked up marriage?

100
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,550
难道不是摆脱过去重新开始的好开端吗
Didn't really help it off to a good start, now, did you?

101
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,220
现在你到底想要怎么样?
Now, just how far do you want to push this?

102
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,390
嗯
Hmm?

103
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,650
这样如何?
How about this far?

104
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,740
现在是谁会吃不消呢  上尉?
Now who's biting off more than they can chew, Captain?

105
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,330
不会是我被打倒  少校
Not me from where I'm standing, Major.

106
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,590
让开
Excuse me.

107
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,320
他看上去不错
He's looking good.

108
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,900
真高兴他体重减轻了
I'm glad he lost the weight.

109
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,990
我也是
Yeah, so am I.

110
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,410
再见
Bye.

111
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,500
女士们好
Hey, ladies.

112
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,590
很不错的组合动作
It was a great combination.

113
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,170
打得不错 李
Great fight, Lee.

114
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,840
比赛时要集中注意力 老兄
Fought with a lot of heart, man.

115
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,100
我亲爱的斗士还好吗
How's my favorite gladiator?

116
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,230
早上好 指挥官
Good morning, Commander.

117
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,980
准备好回舰了?
Ready to go back to our ship?

118
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,880
嗨 如果你打完了 我们安排个私人活动如何
Hey, if you're done brawling, how about we arrange a private tussle?

119
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,670
我还有一场要打
Well, actually I have another bout.

120
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,440
上校
Colonel.

121
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,820
今晚怎样?
How's it going tonight?

122
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,110
拳赛很精彩
Couple of good bouts so far.

123
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,360
你呢 你感觉如何
And you? How're you doing?

124
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,240
我宁愿回到我的小窝里抱着老酒过
I'd rather go back to my rock and crawl under the covers with a bottle,

125
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,200
不过你是对的 这是个好主意
but you were right, this was a good idea.

126
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,620
不必困扰于过去 适应明亮的灯光下的生活
No use going backwards, might as well get used to the bright lights.

127
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,960
开始了 开始了
Let's go. Let's go!

128
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,390
你在这儿
There you are.

129
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,020
嗨 你好吗
Hey, how are you?

130
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,070
没想到找到你的时候是在玩沙子
I didn't expect to find you playing in the sand.

131
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,450
那不是沙子
It's not sand.

132
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,030
那是冲积物 这里过去是河床
It's alluvial deposits. This used to be the river mouth.

133
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,620
那你得把鞋子脱下
And you just had to take off your shoes

134
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,960
才能在冲积物上玩
and play in the alluvial deposits.

135
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,170
多浪漫啊!
How romantic.

136
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,840
你衣服颜色真不错
That's a nice color on you.

137
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,340
谢谢
Thank you.

138
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,220
很高兴见到你  劳拉
It's good to see you, Laura.

139
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,970
我也是  比尔
You, too, Bill.

140
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,190
什么
What?

141
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,780
没什么
Nothing.

142
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,240
我父亲是个搏击迷呢
My father was an avid fight fan.

143
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,790
我很崇拜父亲  所以我也喜欢看精彩的搏击
I adored my father so I love a good fight.

144
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,000
我听说了你所谓的舞会了
I heard about your so-called dance.

145
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,800
是偶然听到的
Accidentally, I might add.

146
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,590
不是私人舞会
Don't take it personally.

147
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,430
这是士兵的传统
It's sort of a private tradition.

148
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,760
传统?
Tradition?

149
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,930
因为老是在军舰上待着会让人沮丧
There's a lot of frustration aboard warships.

150
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,850
争论会带来不合还会演化成仇恨
Arguments become grudges and end up being feuds.

151
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,520
这种形式可以让他们合理地释放压力
It allows them to let off some steam,

152
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,610
以公开的形式  大家都能参与
out in the open so everybody can participate.

153
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,030
不管是什么军衔 只要你把身份牌丢进箱子里
Rank doesn't matter. As long as you throw your tags in the box,

154
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,950
都能参加一个公平的比赛
everyone's fair game.

155
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,370
你把身份牌扔进去了没有?
Did you throw your tags in there?

156
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,210
没有
No.

157
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,170
不 其实我想丢的
No. I wish,

158
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,380
我面对了太多压力
with all the frustrations that I have.

159
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,090
我得提前祝贺你
Congratulations. I may be jumping the gun,

160
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,220
在卡拉狄加上出生的第一个男孩
but first boy born on Galactica.

161
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,980
我就是为这事来找您的 长官
That's the thing I wanted to talk to you about, sir.

162
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,860
凯莉不想孩子出生在这里
Cally doesn't want him born here.

163
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,240
我也不想 毕竟他…
And neither do I. Not if he has a chance

164
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,280
有机会呼吸着新鲜的空气出生
to grow up breathing fresh air.

165
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,570
你要说什么
What are you saying?

166
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,950
谢谢
Thank you.

167
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,830
请允许让我们离开这里的岗位
Well, we both would like to request to be relieved of duty

168
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,620
去新卡布里卡定居
and resettle in New Caprica.

169
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,790
不行
No. No way.

170
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,040
这期间你们得呆在这里
Look, you're both here for the duration.

171
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,400
下一个出场的是热狗!
Next up is Hotdog.

172
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,110
热狗  把你的屁股挪上来  然后选个对手
Hotdog, get your butt up here and pick a partner.

173
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,650
来吧 冠军
Come on there, champ.

174
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,700
谁是你的对手呢  热狗?
TIGH: Who's your partner, Hotdog?

175
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,780
星芭
Starbuck.

176
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,370
你一定是在开玩笑？
You gotta be kidding, right?

177
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,610
上  星芭!  他是你的了
Go, Starbuck. He's yours.

178
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,070
我六岁的时候 我家隔壁有个男孩
When I was six years old, there was this boy in my neighborhood,

179
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,160
他每天都等我放学后把我推倒
he used to wait for me after school and knock me down.

180
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,240
知道我妈妈怎么说吗
Know what my mom told me?

181
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,910
那不是因为我惹怒了他
It wasn't because I pissed him off.

182
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,330
后来我终于明白
I wasn't too much older when I realized

183
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,790
恨的另外一面是爱
that the other side of hatred is love.

184
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,630
这就是情感
It was passion.

185
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,840
这次卡尔对李充满了怒火
Karl is angry at Lee after all this time.

186
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,060
这究竟是为何而战呢?
What is this fight really about?

187
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,480
干得好
That's it.

188
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,500
来吧 来吧
TIGH: Come on. Come on!

189
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,760
她只是要激怒我 就这么简单
She's just been pissing me the frak off, that's all.

190
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,430
现在她要丢下拳套了
Now she's throwing down the gauntlet.

191
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,310
打得好 就该这么打 
That's it. That's the way to fight! Go, go, go.

192
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,730
我不敢相信他们的进度这么快
Can't believe the progress they've made.

193
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,110
一个月以前跟现在完全不一样
You should've seen it a month ago.

194
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,320
嗯  相比这种到处都是垃圾的地方
But I'd still rather sleep in a warm bunk every night

195
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,240
我情愿每晚睡在暖和的军舰铺位上
than muck around in this muck.

196
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,280
今晚的床位会很暖和的
Bunk's gonna be plenty warm tonight.

197
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,500
他同意了
He said yes.

198
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,080
他批准你调职了?
He approved the transfer?

199
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,330
恩
Yeah.

200
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,550
你俩就不会保守点秘密  对吗?
STARBUCK: You two just don't know how to keep a secret, do you?

201
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,840
你们是不是准备和波塔尔一起扛起铁铲呢?
So, what, are you guys here to see Baltar put a shovel in the ground?

202
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,350
"参加我们建设美好明天的庆典"
"Join the celebration as we break ground for a better tomorrow. "

203
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,890
噢  有那么多的废话
Aw, such a load of crap.

204
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,980
会有一个露天酒吧
There's an open bar.

205
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,400
真的吗?  那你们干嘛不参加呢?
Really? See, now why didn't you say so?

206
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,820
李  你最好也表表态  
Lee, you've got to let your better half do the talking for you.

207
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,940
她刚才说到点子上了
She gets right to the point.

208
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,160
让我们去见识下美好的"新明天"吧
Let's go find us a better tomorrow.

209
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,780
我们先走了
Excuse us.

210
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,950
把自己灌醉吧
Knock yourself out.

211
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,620
谢谢 山姆
Thank you, Sam.

212
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,480
谢谢大家
Thank you. Thank you.

213
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:14,160
让我们记住这一天 作为我们
Let this day be remembered as the day that we broke the ground

214
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,490
新的明天的奠基日
for our new tomorrow.

215
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,980
你拉链开了
Your fly's open.

216
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,890
闭嘴
Shut up.

217
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,240
不  一切都会好起来的  对不对?
No, it gets better, okay?

218
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,240
因为到时候他们都会回衣帽间的
They come back to the locker room

219
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,780
会带上手铐  还有两根稻草杆!
with a set of handcuffs and some straw.

220
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,830
他们不会成为朋友的 对吗
They're not gonna be friends, are they?

221
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,920
我一直都想和一个球员约会
You know, I've always wanted to date a ballplayer.

222
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,880
有力的臂弯..
Such great arms.

223
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,300
我猜他有对象了
Guess he's kind of taken now.

224
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,630
是啊 有了
Yeah. Kind of.

225
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,180
这里的天气经常很恶劣
Weather usually sucks down here anyway.

226
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,470
是啊
Yeah.

227
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,810
我在想 或许…
You know, I was thinking it's probably better

228
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,270
还是在卡拉狄加上生小孩更好吧
to have a baby on Galactica anyways.

229
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,110
那里有医务室、医生、药品
You know, there's a sick bay, doctors, medicine.

230
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,530
不  这里会更好
Yeah. No, it'll be better.

231
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,120
我们也会更开心的
Yeah, we'll be happier.

232
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,990
没错
Yeah.

233
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,170
嗨 宝贝 你好啊
Hey, baby. Hi.

234
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,150
我听说山姆上船了
I heard Sam was aboard.

235
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,740
是吗
He was?

236
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,830
运气不错 他现在又走了
With any luck, he's gone now.

237
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,450
怎么回事
What happened?

238
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,210
同样的事总是会发生
Same thing that always happens.

239
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,670
为什么他们不能让事情简单些
Why can't they just make things simple?

240
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,790
他们都认为你该属于他们…
They start thinking that they own you...

241
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,300
他们? 我们在说谁?
They? Which they are we talking about?

242
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,340
山姆还是李
Sam or Lee?

243
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,980
我不想你和她打
I don't want you to fight her.

244
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,320
小杜 我和她之间没什么
Dee, this has nothing to do with us.

245
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,070
卡拉和我 我们要解决些东西
Kara and I, we got a score we gotta settle.

246
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,910
我们会在今晚以这种方式解决
And we're gonna settle it tonight one way or another.

247
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,370
喊下一组来
MAN: Set! Call the next set.

248
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,790
好 谁是下一个
WOMAN: Okay, who's next?

249
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,210
嗨 来啊
Hey, come here.

250
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,590
你看我的眼神怪怪的
You keep giving me these weird looks.

251
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,010
得了 一个男人不能看他老婆吗?
Come on, can't a man look at his wife?

252
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,680
来啊
Come on.

253
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
在哪?
Where?

254
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,100
我有没有告诉你能和你结婚时我又多高兴
Did I ever tell you how glad I am I married you?

255
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,680
不只一次
Not once.

256
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,100
那好  我要搞个特殊的仪式来纪念一下
Well, then I'll save it for a special occasion.

257
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,480
过来
Come here.

258
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,070
他又犯了他初识我时犯的同样错误
He's been making the same mistake since the day he met me.

259
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,950
那时你和扎克在一起?
When you were with Zak?

260
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,660
对 现在我和山姆在一起
Yeah. And now I'm with Sam.

261
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,380
我不知道干嘛要和你说这些
I don't even know why I'm telling you this.

262
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,050
因为人们说忏悔对灵魂有益
'Cause they say confession's good for the soul.

263
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,800
好  好
Yeah! Yeah.

264
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,730
我来告诉你避免烂醉如泥的秘诀
I'll tell you the secret to avoid hangovers.

265
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,060
那就是一直喝 别停下来
Don't stop drinking.

266
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,070
这是战斗 生存本能在起作用
It's combat. Survival instinct starts to kick in.

267
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,570
作出抉择 不要回头看
Make your choice, don't look back.

268
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,950
漂亮的组合拳
That's a beautiful combination.

269
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,330
我错过了什么?
What did I miss?

270
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,290
菲戈斯基  你把战机修好了吗?
Figurski, you done that bird already?

271
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,840
没呢  是回转仪的麻烦
No, the damn gyro's giving me trouble.

272
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,420
拜托了  军士长  我是唯一还在那边的人
Come on, Chief, I'm the only one over there.

273
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,180
妈的!  自己去找点东西喝吧
Frak. Frak it, get yourself a drink.

274
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,020
船要沉啦  军士长?
Ship down, Chief?

275
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,890
对啊  明天再说了
Yeah, we'll get it tomorrow.

276
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,850
也该让他放松下了
I figured I'd give him a little R&R.

277
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,110
不 别抓绳子 别抓绳子
No! Get off the ropes, get off the ropes!

278
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,830
这是个舞会 记得吗?
It's a dance, remember?

279
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,370
没错 我们是需要了挫折
Yeah, you know, we've had our share of set-backs, to be sure,

280
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,000
但我保证只要我们的新建设计划得以实行
but I'm confident that with our new development plan

281
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,000
我们将拥有能够
we should have the infrastructure to be able

282
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,960
应对任何突发事件的基本设施
to deal with any unforeseen circumstances...

283
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,010
抱歉 长官 财政部长刚走过去 我就来
Excuse me, sir. The finance minister. I'll be back.

284
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,390
去吧  
Go ahead.

285
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,060
噢  天啊  我想他都没离开休息过
Oh, my God. I thought he'd never leave.

286
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,810
他是个好小子
He's a good kid.

287
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,320
你说这种东西是当地产的吗?
You're saying this stuff grows around here?

288
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,610
在北面的山上  那儿有一个溪流
In the mountains north of here, there's this little stream

289
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,950
流到这个湖里
that comes down into this lake.

290
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,160
水非常清澈 像玻璃般的清透
The water's so clear, it's like looking through glass.

291
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,630
我想在那边建个小木屋
I'm thinking of building a cabin.

292
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,560
想法不错
It's good.

293
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:12,930
嗯
Mmm.

294
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,930
是不错
It is good.

295
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,190
嗨 走了
MAN: Hey, get out there.

296
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,900
拜托
WOMAN: Come on.

297
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,740
不 不行    拜托
MAN: No, I don't think so. WOMAN: Come on.

298
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,330
不 不
MAN: No, no, no.

299
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,690
好了 我得走了
Okay, I'm out of here.

300
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,020
什么?    是的
What? Yeah.

301
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,310
拜托 这才刚刚开始热身
Come on, things are just getting warmed up.

302
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,690
我知道
I know, exactly.

303
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,070
来吧 跳舞
Come on, dance.

304
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,690
你吸引了很多目光哦
Look, you're catching more than a few looks,

305
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,900
帕伽索斯的指挥官先生
Mr. Commander of the Pegasus.

306
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,950
嗨 知道吗 别理他们
Hey. You know what? Screw them.

307
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,250
嗨 我们已经保持这个秘密那么久了 别让人知道
Hey, we've kept this under wraps so far, okay? Let's not blow it.

308
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,290
特别是在我要调职之前
Anyway, especially not before I'm about to transfer.

309
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,630
我走了 你留下吧
I'll go. You stay.

310
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,760
没有你 我不会留下来的
I'm not staying without you.

311
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,050
你会的    我不会
Yes, you are. No, I'm not.

312
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,850
你会的    我不会
Yes, you are. No. I'm not.

313
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,060
我从没过你这么高兴的样子
I've never seen you this happy.

314
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,730
从没见过
I haven't seen you this happy ever.

315
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,150
你呆在这儿 喝个天昏地暗
You stay right here, you get drunk out of your mind,

316
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,030
明天你会烂醉如泥
and tomorrow you'll have a giant hangover.

317
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
明晚 我会一个人向我的指挥官报道
Tomorrow night I'll come and make it all better

318
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,450
然后一切都会好起来的
when I report to my new commander, in private.

319
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,660
你能说服我的
You can talk me into it.

320
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,520
在殖民一号上 我厌倦了…
Back on Colonial One I grew so tired

321
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,980
透过窗户看星空
of looking at the stars through the window.

322
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:13,200
现在 晚上我到外面看啊看
Now at night I go outside and stare and stare.

323
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:30,500
在破晓前看到一丝光亮
Ever see a little light Before the dawn of the light

324
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,680
和一个女人在溪流边
Got a woman by a stream

325
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,520
要把我所有的梦给她看
Gonna show her all my dreams

326
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,100
这是什么东西?
What the hell is that?

327
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:50,900
一个飞行员朋友总是在座舱里唱这个
A pilot friend of mine used to sing it in the cockpit all the time.

328
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,400
他叫什么名字    胡安
What was his name? Juan.

329
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,450
胡安 很不错
Juan. That's nice.

330
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,410
胡安 加尔文
Juan Calvin.

331
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,420
是真的吗  比尔?
Is this really it, Bill?

332
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,670
我们要在这里这样度过余生吗?
Is this how we're going to spend all the rest of our days?

333
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,130
啊 你这个男人
Yeah. You the man.

334
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,130
你能帮我拿着吗?  谢谢
Can you hold these? Thank you.

335
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,820
军士长
Chief.

336
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,700
把你那又肥又大的屁股挪上来
Get your fat, lazy ass up here.

337
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,090
他是认真的吗
Is he serious?

338
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,840
我们看着瞧
Let's watch and find out.

339
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,180
西洛
Helo.

340
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,190
绑紧点
Make them tight.

341
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,400
是  长官
Yes, sir.

342
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,450
他是个老头了 没事的
He's an old man. It'll be fine.

343
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,490
再说  他也不是认真的
He's not serious anyways.

344
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,130
真想打吗?
Sure about this?

345
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,640
是你要倒霉了
It's your funeral.

346
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,310
加油!  伙计
MAN: Yeah! Do it, buddy.

347
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,470
起来  军士长  我们才刚开始呢
Get up, Chief. We're just getting started.

348
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,030
加油  军士长
Come on, Chief.

349
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,700
我带来更多的
I bring offerings.

350
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,000
真是时候 我喝的可是烈酒
Just in time. I was running on bingo fuel.

351
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,080
喔  看看那里
Wow, look at that.

352
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,380
你都把安德斯喝到桌底下去了
You literally drank Anders under the table.

353
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:28,010
他们和平时判若两人 是吗?
They just don't make them like they used to, do they?

354
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,690
小杜在哪?
Where's Dee?

355
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,100
她正在打包 准备走了
She packed it in to go pack.

356
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,030
那只剩下我们俩了
Guess it's just you and me then.

357
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,660
是啊  就剩下我们俩了
Yup, it's just you and me.

358
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,940
你就是这样对付敌人的吗  军士长?
Is this how you fight your enemies, Chief?

359
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,440
你就是这样为生活奋斗的?
Is this how you fight for your life?

360
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,070
别找借口 让我看看你像个战士的样子 起来!
No excuses. Show me you're a soldier. Get up.

361
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,950
给他看看你的厉害
MAN: Show him to your fullest.

362
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,830
对了 军士长 给他看看
That's it, Chief. Show him.

363
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,100
加油
Come on!

364
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,120
这就是你想要的吗?  这就是你想要的吗?
Is that what you want? Is that what you wanted?

365
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,210
知道吗
You know,

366
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,300
也许我们就这样享受就行了
maybe we should just enjoy this.

367
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,640
是的
I am.

368
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,100
不 不 我是指享受在这里的生活
No, no, I mean, enjoy being here

369
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,480
在这个星球上 能多久就多久
on this planet as long as it lasts.

370
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,730
也许赛昂人会找到我们  也许它们找不到
I mean, maybe the Cylons come back, maybe they don't.

371
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:52,200
但是现在我们要休息一下  
But for now, right now, we've got a break.

372
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,660
或许我们该拥抱这些
Maybe we should embrace it,

373
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,240
珍惜现在拥有的生活
live the life that we've got while we've got it.

374
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:02,790
拥抱这个世界 这样的生活
And embrace this world and this life

375
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,080
看看未来会如何
and see what that brings us.

376
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:16,800
我手下好多人想从战舰上下来 定居在这里
I've got people that want to get off the ship, move down here.

377
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,940
也不能责怪他们 你会怎么做?
Can't say as I blame them, I mean, what are you gonna do?

378
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,190
让他们象囚犯一样困在上面
You gonna keep them up there like prisoners,

379
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,530
没日没夜重复枯燥的工作
running around in circles all night, all day,

380
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,360
等待末日启示?
waiting for the apocalypse?

381
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,540
哦 末日启示已经来临过了
Well, the apocalypse has happened once before.

382
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,830
对
Yeah.

383
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,290
而你无法阻止这一切发生 比尔 无论是过去还是现在
And there was nothing you could do to stop it, Bill, not then, not now.

384
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,130
面对现实吧
I mean, let's get real. Let's get real.

385
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,800
赛昂人回来 我们会死
The Cylons come back, we're dead.

386
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,800
生了重病 我们会死
Disease strikes, we're dead.

387
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,140
地震 火山 飓风
Earthquake, volcano, hurricane,

388
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,180
今天 明天 也许在五年后…
today, tomorrow, five years from now and it's...

389
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,520
你知道我说什么吧?
And you know what I'd say?

390
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,110
生活是个婊子 人总要死
Life's a bitch and then you die.

391
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,240
你知道…  不 我是认真的
You know... No, no, I'm serious.

392
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,830
我想…
I mean, I think that...

393
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,500
我们应该从现在起 把每天每刻
I think we should all look at every moment

394
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,080
都看成是借来的时间
of every day from now on as borrowed time,

395
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,420
人们该过上
and people should live the lives

396
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,760
他们所期望的生活 直到终点
that they want to live before it's over.

397
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,720
我们就别浪费我们拥有的那点时间
Let's stop spending the little time we have left here

398
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,680
来担心末日何时来临了
worrying about when it's gonna end.

399
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,660
好了 好了
Okay. Okay.

400
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,290
看看 这块地方很适合盖间房子
Check it out. It's a great place for a house.

401
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,420
你真的决定不再飞了吗?
So, you're really gonna give up flying?

402
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,630
现在即使继续飞也没什么意思
Flying's gonna suck now anyway.

403
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,380
全都是没完没了的警戒巡逻
Lots of training, endless caps.

404
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,220
战争已经结束了 连同所有有意义的东西
War is over. So is all the good stuff.

405
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,680
别这么说 这不吉利
No, don't say that. You'll jinx it.

406
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,180
嗯
Mmm.

407
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,230
我现在站的位置是什么 厨房吗?
So, what am I standing in now? Is this the kitchen?

408
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
嗯
Mmm.

409
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,400
是卧室
Bedroom.

410
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,610
不 不 不 不 谢谢你了 这不是我想来的地方
No. No, no, no. No thank you. That is not someplace I wanna go,

411
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,330
压根就不想 好吗
or think about or imagine or anything else, okay.

412
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,500
看来是我一厢情愿了
That sounds like a personal problem to me.

413
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,960
就是带我来参观你的房子 是吗
Just give me a tour of your house, okay?

414
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,800
给我看你和你的金字塔男孩未来的漂亮房间
Show me all the great rooms you and Pyramid-Boy are gonna have,

415
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,970
多棒的装饰 还有很酷的家具
all the great views, all the cool furniture.

416
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,270
给我介绍一下卡拉・安德斯未来的幸福生活
Give me a tour of the future life of Kara Anders.

417
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,310
我不会结婚的
I'm not getting married.

418
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,150
那么你所做的又都是为了什么呢  卡拉?
Well, then, what's the point, Kara?

419
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,700
我意思是  你确实爱他  对吧？
I mean, you love him, right?

420
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,080
为什么提这个  李?
Where are we going with this, Lee?

421
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,080
这就是问题所在  难道不是吗？
Well, now that's the question, isn't it?

422
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,340
我们到底要怎样下去?
Where are we going?

423
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,840
我的意思是  如果就这样了
I mean, what if this is it?

424
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,680
卡拉  你的余生
This, the rest of your life, Kara.

425
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,980
这真的是你想过的生活吗?
Is this how you want to spend it?

426
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,230
谁是你想相伴余生的人?
Who you want to spend it with?

427
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,490
你心里有某个人吗 李?
You got someone in mind, Lee?

428
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,210
告诉我你不害怕 我不会来
Tell me you're not afraid that I'm not gonna come along

429
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:18,250
干扰你计划好的未来
and upset your neat little applecart.

430
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,640
或许我希望被干扰
Maybe I want it upset.

431
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,660
看来这下子事情更不好处理了
Well, that makes things more complicated.

432
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,790
是啊
Yeah.

433
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,580
我们该怎么办?
What are we gonna do?

434
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,220
我们该怎么办?
What are we gonna do?

435
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,260
我们接受事实
We accept it.

436
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:55,060
明天我去和杜说  你去告诉山姆
Tomorrow I tell Dee, you tell Sam.

437
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,730
就那样做吗?
Just like that?

438
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,100
就是那样
Just like that.

439
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,150
我不知道
I don't know.

440
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,900
听着  我们告诉他们我们的感受
You know, we tell them how we feel.

441
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,860
我们把想法都冲天喊出来
We shout it to the skies.

442
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,450
是嘛  
Yeah.

443
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,530
是啊  是啊  对
Yeah. Yeah, right.

444
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,290
什么  你不相信我会那样做吗?
What, you don't think I will?

445
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,080
嗯
Mmm-mmm.

446
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,000
嗯
Mmm-mmm.

447
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,330

448
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:29,220
我是李・阿达玛
My name is Lee Adama!

451
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,900
呵呵  又不会有人听到
What? What, it's not like anybody will hear,

452
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,190
我们在你的森林小木屋里  不是吗？
we're in your cabin in the forest, right?

453
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,820
我爱卡拉・瑟瑞丝
I love Kara Thrace!

454
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:50,700
不管谁他妈的知道我都不在乎!
And I don't care who frakking knows!

455
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:58,080
噢  你疯了 过来躺下
Oh, you're crazy. Get down.

456
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,750

Well, come on. I'm not going to stop

457
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,500
否则我不会停下的
until you get up and do it, too.

458
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,090
我办不到
I can't.

459
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:10,510
这是卡拉・瑟瑞丝 赛昂突袭机杀手 她会害怕?
This is Kara Thrace, scourge of the Cylon Raiders. She's afraid?

460
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,010
来吧 起来
Come on, stand up.

461
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,140

卡拉・瑟瑞丝爱李・阿达玛!
Kara Thrace loves Lee Adama!

468
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,640
你确信我是你想要的人?
Are you sure I'm what you want?

469
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,220
没错 你就是
Yeah, you're what I want.

470
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,310
我只是…一直没有意识到这一点
I just don't... I don't think I really knew it

471
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,060
直到我刚才大声说出口
until I said it out loud just now.

472
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,150
为什么
Why?

473
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,410
因为扎克?
Because of Zak?

474
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,750
是吧 还有好多其他事
Yeah, and a lot of things.

475
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,460
最主要是我害怕
Mostly because I was afraid

476
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,260
承认多么需要你
to admit how much I needed you.

477
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:38,100
我有多么需要你
How much I needed anyone.

478
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,560
对
Yeah.

479
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,020
我爱你 卡拉・瑟瑞丝
I love you, Kara Thrace.

480
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,650
我也爱你
I love you, too.

481
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:10,710
加油
Come on!

482
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:30,480
老头子打得不错
The old man's got chops.

483
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:33,820
他知道什么时候进攻 什么时候防守
He knows when to make his moves, when to hold back.

484
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,610
我真希望他儿子也学学他
I wish I could say the same for his son.

485
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,620
你们为什么还要上台打?
Why are you two even fighting?

486
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,410
为什么不直接去开个房?
Why not just get a room?

487
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,580
在那 做那个
Been there, done that.

488
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,710
估计我们都觉得搞错方式了
Guess it just rubbed us both the wrong way.

489
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,880
小杜
Dee,

490
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,720
她说的都是以前的事
what she's talking about was a long time ago.

491
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,430
老早以前的 说明不了什么
A long time ago. It didn't mean anything.

492
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,020
你说你要解决些问题
You said you had something to settle.

493
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,190
去解决吧
Settle it.

494
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,610
就今晚
Tonight.

495
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,190
听我说啊…
Listen to me. Listen.

496
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,780
又只剩我们两个了
And once again, it's just you and me.

497
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,290
你他妈的
You motherfrakker!

498
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,500
别这么想 好吗
Hold that thought, okay?

499
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:32,790
老爸  加油!
Come on, Dad!

500
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,220
不太好  已经够了  你该认输了
That's bad. That's enough already. You should quit.

501
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:04,640
把血止上就行了
Just stop the blood.

502
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,060
拿止血剂来消肿止血
Coagulant for the swelling as for the bleeding.

503
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,230
拜托 天啊
Come on. Christ.

504
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:12,270
你还要坚持吗
You insist on doing this?

505
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:14,400
你还要打  你疯了吗?
You wanna do this, you're crazy, right?

506
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,520
你真想继续打吗?      是的
You wanna do this? Yeah.

507
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,610
那好  你要防守好  他要发狠了
All right. Keep your guard up, he's coming in wild,

508
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,450
你要用左勾拳还击 你想要赢吗?
get him with a left hook. You wanna win?

509
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,570
我赢不了的
I'm not gonna win.

510
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,590
当心他的直拳
You gotta watch his jab. Watch his jab.

511
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:38,750
他的直拳太狠了  听到了吗?
His jab's killing you, all right?

512
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,880

00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,880
保持体力 小心直拳 上吧
Keep strong, watch his jab. Here we go.

516
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:50,640

You'll feel better, trust me.

520
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:07,030
军士长  早上好  早上好  凯莉
Chief, good morning. Good morning, Kelly.

521
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:14,460
我仔细考虑了你说的话 或许你是对的
I've been thinking about what you said, and you may be right,

522
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,920
关于你的话…
about what you said.

523
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,090
不好意思 什么?
I'm sorry, what?

524
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,800
哦 好吧
Oh, right.

525
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,100
关于要下来定居的事
About living down here.

526
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,440
一艘太空堡垒没地方养个家庭
A Battlestar's no place to raise a family.

527
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,310
我会想念你的  军士长
So I'm gonna miss you, Chief.

528
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,270
祝你好运
But I'm gonna wish you good luck.

529
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,830
谢谢你  长官
Thank you, sir.

530
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,330
衷心祝福你们
My best to both of you.

531
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,830
我们可以搬家了?  真的吗?
We're moving? Really?

532
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,670
谢谢你
Thank you.

533
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,790
我希望你俩将来至少生一打
I want you guys to have at least a dozen.

534
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:03,590
你会看到的
We'll see about that.

535
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,290
起来 我们帮你
Get up. We'll get you up.

536
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:59,410
当你们站在这个甲板上 你们就要作好战斗的准备
When you stand on this deck, you be ready to fight,

537
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,290
否则你就是质疑我们在里的原因
or you dishonor the reason why we're here.

538
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,210
请记住
And remember this.

539
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:14,470
当你在和某人战斗时  他就不再是你的朋友
When you fight a man, he's not your friend.

540
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,020
当你们领导别人的时候  也是一样的
The same goes when you lead men.

541
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,900
我曾经忽略过一次
I forgot that once.

542
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,940
我让你们都走得太近了 所有的人
I let you get too close. All of you.

543
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,450
我放松了自己的警惕
I dropped my guard.

544
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,840
我让这个团队 这个大家庭几乎分崩瓦解
I let this crew, and this family, disband.

545
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,840
我们为此付出了生命的代价
And we paid the price in lives.

546
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,350
我不会让这种事情再发生了
That can't happen again.

547
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,960
菲戈斯基 你跟我来
Figurski, you're with me.

548
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,510
让我们去把那架战机修好
Let's get that bird back on the line.

549
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,930
总统女士
Madam President.

550
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,220
上将
Admiral.

551
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:55,700
好了  这次"舞会"就此结束
All right. This dance is over.

552
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:59,160
带上你们的酒瓶 身份牌  都散了
Get your booze and your dog tags and let's get out of here.

553
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,830
怎么  你就这样结束了?
So what, you're just gonna call it?

554
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:04,330
今晚你还不够兴奋吗  上尉?
Not enough excitement for one night for you, Captain?

555
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,920
嗨 嗨
STARBUCK: Hey. Hey!

556
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,550
你他妈的想躲哪去?
Where the frak do you think you're going?

557
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,260
结束了  卡拉
It's over, Kara.

558
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:21,510
那又怎么样?
So what?

559
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,810
你有胆量勾搭另一个男人的女人
You have the guts to try and frak

560
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:26,180
却不敢和一个女人在拳台上较量？
another man's woman, but not to fight one?

561
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:30,440
小杜是否知道她的男人是个什么样的孬种
I wonder if Dee knew what she was getting.

562
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,770
觉得她会顺从这样的男人吗？
Think she would have settled for sloppy seconds?

563
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,700
真相很伤人  不是吗?
The truth stings, don't it?

564
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:46,540
你想较量一下吗  上尉？
You want a fight, Captain?

565
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,330
如你所愿
You've got it.

566
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,340
你男朋友在呼呼大睡
Your boyfriend snores.

567
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:46,100
我来告诉你避免烂醉如泥的秘诀
I'll tell you the secret to avoid hangovers.

568
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,350
那就是一直喝 别停下来
Don't stop drinking.

569
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,010
这是你第一次和我一起喝酒
Well, I think that is the first drink you've

570
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,140
卡拉・瑟瑞丝上尉
ever had with me, Captain Kara Thrace.

571
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,470
肯定有什么特别的事
Must be a special occasion.

572
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,730
我昨晚和李睡了
I slept with Lee last night.

573
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:59,670
你能别笑了吗 这不好玩
Would you stop it? It's not funny.

574
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,760
不好玩
It's not!

575
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,560
我是个白痴
I'm such an idiot.

576
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:16,350
是你说的 我没这么说
Well, you said it, I didn't.

577
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:29,450
嗨
Hey.

578
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:33,120
干嘛不和我说说整件事
Why don't you tell me all about it?

579
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,120
我得选条路
I gotta make a move.

580
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,090
二择其一
One way or the other.

581
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,380
这是战斗 
It's combat.

582
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:47,640
生存本能在起作用
Survival instinct starts to kick in.

583
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,430
作出抉择 不要回头看
Make your choice, don't look back.

584
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:52,520
生存本能 嗯?
Survival instinct, huh?

585
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,350
是
Yeah.

586
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:17,870
早上好 指挥官 准备回舰了吗
Good morning, Commander. Ready to go back to our ship?

587
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,840
就这样保守秘密啊
So much for keeping a lid on things.

588
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:30,590
怎么了
What's going on?

589
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,350
我们离开这鬼地方吧
Let's get the hell out of here.

590
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,610
怎么 怕打到我
What? You afraid to hit me?

591
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,580
还是根本打不到?
Or maybe you can't.

592
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:13,970
起来 星芭 起来 你能行的
Get up! Starbuck, get up! You can do this.

593
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,540
早上好  上将
Good morning, Admiral.

594
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:45,380
你看上去精神不错啊
You look like you had a good time.

595
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,460
是啊  参加了几个派对
Yeah, it was some party.

596
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,760
噢  这个早上也不寻常啊
Yeah, well, it's been a hell of a morning, too.

597
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,680
你错过了精彩的部分
You missed all the excitement.

598
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,260
为什么?  上面出了什么问题吗？
Why? Is it problems upstairs?

599
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,890
不  
No.

600
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:58,100
不 是好事情 卡拉结婚了
No, good things. Kara got married.

601
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,480
相信吗?
You believe that?

602
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,940
什么?
What?

603
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,480
嗯  大概一个小时之前
Yeah, about an hour ago.

604
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,440
她自己找了个牧师 婚礼在河边举行的
Found herself a priest, went down by the river and got married.

605
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,740
你没事吧?
You okay?

606
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,590
你能相信吗?
ADAMA: Can you believe that?

607
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:36,890
她理应得到他
Well, she deserves that man.

608
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:39,220
我们都应该得到幸福
We all deserve to be happy.

609
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:43,940
我已经同意她离开舰队 跟泰罗尔和凯莉一起
I also gave her permission to muster out, along with Tyrol and Cally.

610
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:46,230
还有其他几个人  所以…
A few of the others, so...

611
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:49,400
我们得确保没有大规模的离职
We have to ask to make sure there's no mass exodus.

612
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,840
嘿  伙计!你听到消息了吗?
Hey, man. Did you hear the news?

613
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,350
我们结婚了 我们结婚了!
We're hitched. We got married.

614
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,100
你能相信吗?
Can you believe it?

615
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,020
不  不  我无法相信
No. No, I can't believe it.

616
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:27,230
是啊 太不可思议了 她过来我这儿  把我叫醒
Yeah. You know, it was crazy. She comes down and she wakes me up,

617
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,440
突然提出结婚  然后把我拽到牧师那里
she pops the question, she drags me down to the priest,

618
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,360
然后  哇  一眨眼间  我们结婚了
and bang! Like that. We're married.

619
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:35,570
这么说是你的主意
So it was your idea.

620
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,790
没错 是我的主意
Yeah. It was my idea.

621
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:48,040
你俩是不是需要点时间单独聊聊
SAM: Do you guys want a minute to, you know, talk?

622
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:50,540
祝贺你  山姆
Congratulations, Sam.

623
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:51,710
谢谢
Yeah.

624
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,380
祝好运
And good luck.

625
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,260
你们需要这个
You're gonna need it.

626
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,990
怎么 我犯规了?
Oops. Did I break the rules?

627
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:31,290
你只做了一件事 不惜一切保护自己
You've only got one. Protect yourself at all costs.

628
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:45,520
你从不让人进去心扉
You never let anybody get inside.

629
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:47,140
我作出了选择
I made my choice.

630
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:48,640
你跑开了
You ran away.

631
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:51,770
加油 姑娘 你能打到他!
WOMAN: Let's go, girl. You can take him!

632
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,950
真相很伤人 不是吗
The truth stings, don't it?

633
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,830
你这个伪君子 你做了什么选择呢?
You frakking hypocrite. What choice did you make?

634
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,790
怎么了
What's going on?

635
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,290
这是在干嘛
What's it look like?

636
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,710
看上去他们想杀了对方
Looks like they're trying to kill each other.

637
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,590
从某个角度来看
From one perspective.

638
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,260
到底怎么回事
Where is this coming from?

639
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:26,970
我不知道 我也在想
I don't know. I've been thinking about it for a while.

640
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,770
不 这是谎话
No, that's a lie.

641
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:32,060
我不想用谎话作为开局 
And I don't wanna start this with a lie.

642
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,860
卡拉和安德斯早上结婚了
Kara and Anders got married this morning.

643
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,900
怎么? 他们结婚有什么特别的？
And what, they're having a two-for-one special?

644
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:47,870
当卡拉说她结婚了的时候 我就在想
When Kara said she was married, it really made me think

645
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,250
我想要过什么样的生活
about the life I wanna live now.

646
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:55,750
我希望和你在一起
And I want you in that life.

647
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:59,670
和你在一起度过的日子
The times we've been together,

648
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,010
是我这生中最快乐的日子
they're the happiest I've ever been. Ever.

649
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:07,010
小杜 嫁给我好吗
So, please, Dee, will you marry me?

650
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,980
你是不是忘了什么
Aren't you forgetting something?

651
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,020
你爱卡拉・瑟瑞丝
You love Kara Thrace.

652
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:17,900
什么 不
What? No.

653
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,570
你们之间有某种关系
The two of you were linked somehow,

654
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:25,450
我是说 会有一天 你会来跟我说
and I mean, one day, you're gonna turn to me and say,

655
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,280
“小杜 我很抱歉 可是...”   不会的
"Dee, I'm sorry, but... " That's not gonna happen.

656
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:29,240
会的    不会
It will happen. No.

657
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,460
但是好吧
And yes,

658
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,710
我会嫁给你的
I'll marry you.

659
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:40,630
你同意了?
You will?

660
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,090
我也在想
I've been thinking, too.

661
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:48,640
或许我们现在是安全的 可谁知道能持续多久呢
Maybe we're safe, but who knows for how long?

662
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,390
我要把每一天都当作最后一天来过
I wanna live my life like every moment is gonna be my last.

663
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,730
我甚至会嫁给你 李・阿达玛
I'll even marry you, Lee Adama.

664
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,980
我会爱你 珍惜你
And I will love you and cherish you

665
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:04,950
直到赛昂人来
until the Cylons come back,

666
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:08,160
或者到卡拉・瑟瑞丝走进你的生活
or until Kara Thrace walks back into your life.

667
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,830
小杜 她不会回来
Dee, she's not walking back.

668
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:12,660
我是说…
I mean...

669
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,250
吻我
Just kiss me.

670
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,290
在我改变主意前吻我
Kiss me before I change my mind.

671
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:28,180
加油    打啊 姑娘
MAN: Let's go! MAN 2: Fight, girl!

672

01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:41,360
好啊
Yeah!

676
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,280
你想了解一切?
You're trying to finish things?

677
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,580
把他放倒 宝贝
Put him down, baby.

678
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,710
加油
Come on.

679
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:23,610
放开我
Let go of me.

680
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:28,490
为什么 好让你多打我几下?
Why? So that you can hit me some more?

681
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,490
对
Yeah.

682
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:37,410
好吧 我可能走都走不了了
Well, I may not be able to walk anymore.

683
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:42,090
你打破了我的鼻子
I think you busted my nose.

684
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:46,010
我们算是打平了 怎么样?
How about we call this a tie, huh?

685
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,570
我出去了
I'm out of here.

686
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:20,210
我想你
I missed you.

687
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:28,050
我也想你
I missed you, too.

688
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,050
我也想你
I missed you, too.

689
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,310
看来事情又变复杂了
I think things just got more complicated.

690
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:07,090
别 别 别现在
No, no, not now.
