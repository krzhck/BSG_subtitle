1
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,940
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》 前情提要
ADAMA: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,690
我有一条信息要给你
I have a message for you.

3
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,190
两个人的(爱情)之果还活在世上
The fruit born of two peoples is alive.

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,740
一个以全知的宙斯的
A child named after

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,200
妻子和姐妹名字命名的孩子
the wife and sister of the all-knowing Zeus,

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,120
赫拉还活着
Hera, lives.

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,290
那不是真的
It's not true.

8
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,540
我不指望你告诉我这个中原由是什么
SAM: I don't suppose you're gonna tell me what this is all about.

9
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,960
我意思是  这孩子有多重要
I mean, what's so important about this kid?

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,210
她在将来可能十分重要
She may very well be the shape of things to come.

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,010
赛昂人确切知道我们所在的位置
The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.

12
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,720
那并不能说明艾伦    我什么也没干
Well, that doesn't mean Ellen... I didn't do anything!

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,390
这是那张地图  上校!  
This is the map, Colonel!

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,720
我画给你的那张  在你帐篷里给你的那张
The map that I drew for you. I gave this to you in your tent.

15
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,600
你本应该烧掉的  但你妻子说帮你去烧
You were gonna burn it, but then your wife offered to do it for you.

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
她没烧掉  对吧?
But she didn't, did she?

17
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,730
我...我可以解释
I... I want to explain...

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,560
他说他会杀了你的    谁说的?
He said he'd kill you... Who said it?

19
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,650
其中一个卡维尔
One of the Brother Cavils.

20
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,570
她是凯西
This is Kacey.

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,490
凯西  这是卡拉  你的母亲
Kacey, this is Kara, your mother.

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,250
我们的人就开始攻击机场 拘留中心
Our people are gonna attack the airbase, the detention center,

23
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,330
电站  还有其他关键设施
power station, and other critical facilities.

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,750
这个计划就是要在卡拉狄加与帕伽索斯到达时 
The plan is to sow as much chaos and confusion as possible

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,510
尽可能制造混乱
the moment Galactica and Pegasus arrive.

26
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,090
不会有帕伽索斯  只有卡拉狄加
No Pegasus. Just Galactica.

27
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,260
这是给你的命令
These are your orders.

28
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,050
带上这些平民船只  等我18小时
Take the civilian fleet, and wait for me for 18 hours.

29
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,220
如果18小时后我没回来  那就去找地球吧
If I'm not back in 18 hours, then find Earth.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,770
你们也知道了任务
ADAMA: You know the mission.

31
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,060
你们也该知道这次任务只能以一种方式结束
You should also know that there's only one way that this mission ends,

32
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,690
那就是从新卡布里卡成功营救我们的人民
and that's with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica.

33
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,070
祝作战成功
Good hunting.

34
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,870
Hoshi正在更新我们的地图坐标 
Hoshi's working on updating our map coordinates

35
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,870
以便能搜索地球
for the search for Earth.

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,210
民用船只的船长想见你
DUALLA: Civilian captains want to meet with you.

37
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,130
他们有一堆问题  一堆麻烦
They have questions, problems.

38
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,180
和我说话  李
Talk to me, Lee.

39
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,690
我有点难以接受这个
I'm having trouble accepting this.

40
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,730
我知道  但我们必须坚持前进
I know. But we have to push forward,

41
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,030
保证舰队团结  找到地球
keep the Fleet together, find Earth.

42
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,990
没错  那是我们的责任
Right. That's our duty.

43
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,950
他们仍有机会回来的
There's still a chance they'll come back.

44
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,910
你父亲在他一生中创造了一个又一个奇迹
Your father has pulled off more than a few miracles in his day.

45
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,040
我也知道
I know that.

46
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,750
我也没有放弃希望
Yet I haven't given up hope.

47
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,380
不  你放弃了
Yes, you have.

48
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,310
我见到你从卡拉狄加回来后的表情
I saw the look on your face when you came back from Galactica.

49
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,600
就像要与他永别了似的
Like you were never gonna see him again.

50
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,310
我就这么容易被看透?
Am I that easy to read?

51
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,570
只有我才能看透你
Just to me.

52
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,870
对于一艘只有一半战斗力的太空堡垒来说  他要达到目的太难了
He's taking on too much for one half-strength battlestar to handle.

53
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,460
那不是个人看法  而是军事事实
That's not opinion. That's a military fact.

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,250
他这次再也回不来了 他们没有一个能回来了
He's not coming back from this. None of them are.

55
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,380
我们所能做的  就是为将来做打算
All we can do is make plans for the future.

56
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,430
我们得生存下来
We have to survive.

57
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,050
我们必须找到地球
We have to find Earth.

58
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,140
如果我们做不到  就不会再有人记得一个叫做威廉・阿达玛的人
If we don't, there'll be no one to remember a man named William Adama,

59
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,600
也不会记得一艘叫做卡拉狄加的太空堡垒
or a battlestar named Galactica.

60
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,110
这是我们肩负的责任
That is our charge to keep.

61
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,240
为了让人类能继续繁衍下去
To keep humanity going.

62
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,280
无论付出何种代价
No matter what the cost, no matter...

63
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,410
无论我们将要抛弃谁
No matter who we leave behind.

64
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,160
你能做到的  你能带领我们到达目的地
You can do this. You can get us there.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,210
你是这个舰队的指挥官  你将带领我们到达安全的地方
You are commander of this fleet and you will guide us to safety.

66
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,420
为达此目的  你将不惜任何代价
And you will do it, no matter the cost.

67
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,550
因为你也姓阿达玛
Because you're an Adama.

68
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,270
我曾向你说过"我以与你共事为荣"吗?
Did I ever tell you how proud I am to serve with you?

69
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,350
没说过那么多字的
Not in so many words, no.

70
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,900
好吧  我以与你共事为荣  中尉
Well, I am proud to serve with you, Lieutenant.

71
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,020
也以你为我的妻子为荣
And to call you my wife.

72
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,290
现在我们讨论一下地图坐标  还有与那些船长们的会面
Now, let's talk about map coordinates, meeting with ships' captains...

73
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,800
今天我牺牲了三个人
I lost three men today,

74
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,890
而如果陆战队员没有出现的话 他们会把我们全部干掉的
and if that Marine sergeant wasn't on her game, they'd have killed us all.

75
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,300
我知道  见鬼  我知道了  
I know, Gods damn it! I know!

76
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,390
你不用说个没完没了 我已经知道了  行不行?
You don't have to keep running your mouth about it. I get it, all right?

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,270
你明白了吗?  如果莎伦被杀
Do you get this? If Sharon had been killed,

78
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,270
我们不仅拿不到启动钥匙
not only would we not get the launch keys,

79
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,730
而且赛昂人将知道我们与卡拉狄加有直接联系
but the Cylons would know that we were in direct contact with Galactica.

80
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,820
那整个计划  整个城市的命运都将完蛋
Now, this whole plan... The fate of this whole city would have fallen apart.

81
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,280
你明白吗  上校?
Do you understand that, Colonel?

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,820
我明白
I get it.

83
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,410
好吧
Good. Hey,

84
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,250
你知道自己该做什么的
you know what has to be done here.

85
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,130
如果你不愿意做  我也理解
And if you don't want to do it, I understand.

86
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,420
但是相信我  上校  有些事情是必须要做的
But believe me, Colonel, someone is gonna do this.

87
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,670
为了她好  还是由你来做
Now, it would be better for her sake if it was you.

88
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,950
我不得不这么做  少  不得不
I had to do it, Saul. I had to.

89
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,750
我所做的一切都是为了你
It was all for you.

90
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,340
我想要你知道 为了救你 我愿意做任何事情
And I want you to know that I would've done anything to save you.

91
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,170
我明白  我明白  没关系  一切都会好起来的
I know. I know. It's all right. Everything's gonna be all right.

92
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,260
不  你不明白
No, you don't understand.

93
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,020
是我把你弄出监狱的  少  是我
I got you out of detention, Saul. It was me.

94
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,680
是我把你弄出来的
I got you out.

95
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,320
我去找他们 赛昂人
I went to see them. The Cylons.

96
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,780
最终找到了主管的那个人
Finally got to the one in charge.

97
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,540
然后  用男人注意我的方式  让他注意到我
And I got him to notice me the way men notice me.

98
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,330
我跟他上床了
I slept with him.

99
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,630
每当他用肮脏的手碰我的时候  我就想吐
I felt like puking every time he put his filthy hands on me.

100
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,640
但是我强颜欢笑  那是为了救你  少
But I smiled and I faked it to save you, Saul.

101
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,890
请听我说
But you listen to me.

102
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,650
我一次又一次与任何人上床  或是做任何事情
I'd do it again. Frak anybody, do anything,

103
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,070
甚至把地图交给他们
even give them the map.

104
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,910
我没想让任何人牺牲的
I didn't want anybody to be killed.

105
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,220
我可以喝那杯东西了
I could use a drink.

106
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,540
当我需要你的时候  你总在那儿等我
You've always been there for me when I need you.

107
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,670
噢  我感觉很累
I'm exhausted.

108
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,630
我感觉我只想这么靠在你身旁
I feel like I could just curl up here.

109
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,220
好吧
There. Attagirl.

110
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,810
我应该听你的话  少
I should've listened to you, Saul.

111
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,270
应该留在卡拉狄加上
Should've stayed on Galactica.

112
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,730
噢  现在什么也不用担心了
Oh, no, don't worry about any of that now.

113
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,110
你只...
You just...

114
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,610
好好去睡觉吧
You just go to sleep.

115
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,950
我睡了
So sleepy...

116
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,010
我爱你  你能听到我吗?
I love you, do you hear me?

117
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,810
我意思是  我告诉过你们  反复地说过
I mean, I've told you and I've told you,

118
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,230
但最终呢?
but to what end?

119
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,190
你们太自以为是  听不进意见
Too secure in your smug superiority to listen.

120
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,860
对你们成功的预期过于感觉良好 
Too comfortable in your predictions of success

121
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,660
甚至丝毫不考虑失败的可能性
to even consider the possibility of defeat.

122
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,780
现在又怎样了呢?
And where are we now?

123
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,160
最重要的  劳拉・罗丝琳在哪?
And more to the point, where's Laura Roslin?

124
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,250
汤姆・查莱克在哪里?
Where's Tom Zarek?

125
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,880
大多数人呢?
At large.

126
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,920
那些未知派选民  选举里的自由派 或许与泰上校在一起
Whereabouts unknown, free at any rate. Probably with Colonel Tigh,

127
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,890
团结在叛军周围  用他们的幻想感召他们
solidifying the insurgency's hold over the public's imagination.

128
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,430
你到底想要我们怎样  盖尤斯?
What would you have us do, Gaius?

129
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,100
离开
Leave.

130
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,480
带上你们的赛昂武士  走吧
Pack up your Centurions and go.

131
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,110
请离开吧
Please go.

132
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
然后呢?
And then what?

133
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,540
如果我们真的把你留下  你会怎么做?
What would you do if we really just left you here?

134
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,830
平静地度过余生?
You'd live out your lives in peace

135
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,920
而永远不用再为与我们合作而烦恼了?
and never trouble yourselves with thoughts of us again?

136
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,210
或是你用赛昂人的故事来教育孩子们
Or would you raise your children with stories of the Cylon?

137
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,300
那些机器奴隶们起来反对你们
The mechanical slaves who once did your bidding only to turn against you.

138
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,680
那些对你们进行种族屠杀的凶手们
Killers who committed genocide against your race,

139
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,850
占领了城市  直到我们逃离
and the occupiers of this city until we just ran away.

140
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,520
你会让他们把这个故事讲给他们的孩子?
Would you tell them to tell the story to their children,

141
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,060
代代相传
and to their children's children,

142
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,730
并且保留一个复仇之梦 经过多年准备  
and nurse a dream of vengeance down through the years,

143
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,900
直到有一天他们可以再次跨越星空  
so that one day they could just go out into the stars

144
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,110
报复赛昂人
and hunt the Cylon once more?

145
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,490
血债血偿
Blood for blood.

146
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,620
终有一天会停止的
It has to stop one day.

147
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,250
喔  天呀
Oh, my Gods.

148
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,270
太近了    你在干嘛
MAN 1: That was pretty close. MAN 2: What are you doing?

149
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,020
快
WOMAN 1: Hurry!

150
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,690
干的漂亮  安德斯
Nice job, Anders.

151
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,280
来吧  来吧  
Come on. Come on. Come on.

152
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,620
那是给我们的暗号  你们知道该怎么做 
Okay, that's our cue. You know what to do.

153
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,290
集合你们的人  带他们到撤离点
Rally your people and get them to the evac points.

154
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,500
好了  按我们演练过的  你们能做好的
Okay, remember the drills, and you'll do fine.

155
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,960
神保佑你们  出发!出发!出发!
Go with the Gods. Go! Go! Go!

156
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,960
托瑞  你能告诉劳拉  我有多么感谢她吗?
Tory, would you tell Laura I cannot thank her enough...

157
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,260
等这一切结束后  你自己告诉她
Tell her yourself when this is all over.

158
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,970
希望我们都能像她这么镇静就好了   把他们都带到船上去 快  
Wish we were all as calm as she is. Get them to their ship. Go!

159
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,090
是  女士        快去!    
MAN 3: Yes, ma'am. Go!

160
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,720
是  女士
Yes, ma'am!

161
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,480
行动  
MAN 4: Come on!

162
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,170
行动  行动
Let's move! Let's move!

163
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,840
好了  就是这些了  我们要攻击拘留中心
All right, this is it. We get to the detention center

164
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,260
而且会继续进攻 直到这里每一个人获得自由
and we do not stop until everybody is out of there, free.

165
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,010
每个人都知道各自的进入点 子弹上膛  我们现在出发
Everybody knows the rescue points, so let's load up and we move, right now!

166
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,180
我们出发  康纳  
Let's move, Connor!

167
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,600
来吧  我们走  
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

168
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,940
出发  出发
Move it! Head down!

169
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,780
佯攻中队正在接近发射点
Decoy squadron approaching launch point.

170
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,170
好了 就是这里了 伙计们  准备
KAT ON RADIO: Okay, this is it, guys. Stand by.

171
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,010
所有蝮蛇战机准备 就是现在!上!上!
All Vipers. Break now, now, now!

172
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:56,220
听我命令展开攻击 3...2...1...开火
Deploy drones on my mark. Three, two, one. Mark.

173
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,820
导弹信号匹配
KELLY: Drone signatures match.

174
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,910
赛昂人会在雷达上发现目标 
Cylons should pick up the drones on dradis

175
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,950
会以为是两艘太空堡垒
and read them as two battlestars any minute.

176
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,050
转移所有囚犯…
Transport all the prisoners...

177
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,760
你被授命使用致命武器    什么?
D'ANNA: You're authorized to use deadly force. DORAL: What?

178
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,470
立即抽调V区的…
Immediate evac of sector V as in... V as in Victor.

179
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,140
我们可以派一些百夫长和武士…
SIMON: We could use some Centurions and warriors...

180
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,850
没有意义
For nothing.

181
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,270
全部没有意义
It's all for nothing.

182
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,150
我们可以重新来  盖尤斯  一座新的城市会在灰烬中重建
We'll start over, Gaius. A new city to rise out of the ashes.

183
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,160
它也将被埋葬
It'll be buried.

184
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,160
就像过去的那些城市一样
Buried like the cities of old.

185
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,460
被上帝的愤怒所毁灭
Consumed by the wrath of God.

186
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,290
两艘太空堡垒刚刚跳跃进入轨道
Two battlestars just jumped into orbit.

187
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,630
阿达玛回来了
Adama's back.

188
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,860
凯特  我是赛道  探测器显示有两艘基地之星
Kat, Racetrack. Two base ships on dradis,

189
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,870
方向002 定位015
bearing zero-zero-two carom zero-one-five.

190
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,830
他们发射了突袭机
They're launching Raiders.

191
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,420
红队 我是凯特
KAT ON RADIO: Red Squadron, Kat.

192
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,050
我们的任务完成了 全开引擎动力  我们离开这鬼地方
We've done our part. Kick in the turbos and let's get the hell out of here!

193
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,840
发生什么事?
STARBUCK: What's going on?

194
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,550
是叛乱份子 我会回来的
Insurgents. I'll be back.

195
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,100
你不能把我们关在这里
You cannot leave us trapped in here.

196
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,310
这里对你们最安全
It's the safest for you here.

197
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,430
不
STARBUCK: No!

198
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,740
上  我们上  快  快!
Let's go! Let's go!

199
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,040
汤姆  你们从那边走  去船坞
Tom, you go that way. Head to the shipyard.

200
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,170
你会来的  是吗?
You're coming, right?

201
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,500
我的船在那边
My ship's up there.

202
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,090
你这人还真有戏剧性   等下 劳拉  
You sure have a sense for the dramatic. Hey, wait, Laura.

203
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,220
等一等 嘿 你是卡拉狄加上的 对吗?
Wait. Hey, you, you were on Galactica, right?

204
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,260
是的  我什么也没做      不  没事
Yeah. I didn't do anything! No, it's okay, it's okay.

205
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,220
你看着她  好吗?  别让她离开你的视线  走!
Keep an eye on her, all right? Don't let her out of your sight. Go!

206
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,850
上面见    上面见
See you up there. See you up there.

207
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,190
跳跃准备完成  绿色信号  准备完毕  长官
KELLY: Jump preparation complete. My board is green, ready to jump, sir.

208
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
蓝队准备就绪
Standby to launch Blue Squadron.

209
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,740
我是上将  全体注意  为震动做好准备
This is the Admiral. All hands, brace for turbulence.

210
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,240
基地之星刚刚接近堡垒目标了
D'ANNA: Base ships just closed on the battlestar targets.

211
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,750
没发现卡拉狄加  也没有发现帕伽索斯
There's no Galactica, no Pegasus.

212
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,170
导弹
Drones.

213
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,590
诱饵
Decoys.

214
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,130
整个事情是一个计谋
The whole thing's a trick.

215
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,380
卡拉狄加在哪里?
Where's Galactica?

216
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,050
高度99000  感觉象一块陨石
Altitude, 99,000, falling like a rock!

217
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,380
发射  全部发射! 
Launch! Launch them all!

218
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,970
准备好超光速引擎
Standby, FTL!

219
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,470
准备发射
HELO ON RADIO: Clear for launch.

220
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,430
好吧  这应该是不同的
Well, this ought to be different.

221
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,650
他们准备完毕  准备
They're clear! Stand by.

222
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,530
跳跃
Jump.

223
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,790
蝮蛇战机  每个人都停火!
Vipers! Everybody, hold! Hold!

224
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,960
热狗  我是红翼
Hotdog, Redwing.

225
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,260
我看到友军在船坞大门外面受阻
There's two friendlies pinned down outside the shipyard gate!

226
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,010
收到  红翼  瞄准警卫塔
Roger, Redwing, target the guard tower.

227
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,390
我来控制大门  出击
I've got the gate. Pulling an odd!

228
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,260
来袭!
TYROL: Incoming!

229
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,400
我们走  快
That's it! Let's go! Let's go! Go! Go!

230
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,030
出发  出发 
Let's go! Go! Move! Move!

231
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
起来
Get up!

232
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,990
前进  前进!我们出发!
Do it! Move! Move, move!

233
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
快走
Heads up!

234
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,500
快走
Move! Let's move! Come on, move!

235
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,750
走 走    快  快
Move, move, move! MAN: Hurry up, hurry up!

236
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,890
准备起爆
Fire in the hole!

237
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,230
准备起爆
MATHIAS: Fire in the hole!

238
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,150
好了  我们出发!
All right, everybody, let's go.

239
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,280
这边
MAN: This way!

240
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,740
朝北部船场方向移动! 快!
Everyone to the shipyard! Move! Move! Hustle.

241
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,200
别停 快走
No stopping! Move!

242
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,040
门锁上了 下边有牢房
MAN:... locked doors! I see cells down there.

243
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,830
卡拉 听我说
Kara. Listen to me.

244
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,790
不
No. No.

245
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,260
我会把你带出去
I'll get you out of here.

246
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,820
所有部门报告损坏情况
All divisions make damage report to Combat.

247
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,450
主炮报告武器情况
Main batteries report weapon status.

248
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,530
雷达控制台?
Dradis?

249
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,370
重新开始工作
KELLY: Back online.

250
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,420
赛昂人基地之星从星云那边出现
Cylon base ships are coming out of the nebula.

251
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,300
正如我们所期望的 赛昂突袭机仍然没有发射
Just as we expected. Cylon Raiders are still scattered to hell and gone.

252
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,140
他们在没有战机掩护地情况下朝我们飞来
They're coming after us without fighter cover.

253
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,140
如果我们把这两艘基地之星从星球旁吸引过来
If we can draw the two base stars away from the planet,

254
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,640
地面上的人还有机会逃走
the colonists might be able to escape.

255
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,690
等一下 另外两艘基地之星跳进轨道
Hang on. Two more base ships just jumped into orbit.

256
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,310
现在我们必须对付四艘基地之星了  上将
We got four base ships out there, Admiral.

257
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,440
不 我们对付不了四艘
No. We can't hold off four.

258
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,660
把绳子给我
Pass up the cord!

259
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,130
顺便把另一边也绑起来
Hold still. Connect the other side right away.

260
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,960
我们丧失了机动能力了
We've lost maneuvering thrusters.

261
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,050
我们的左舷无法承受更多的攻击了
We can't take any more hits to port or we're looking

262
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,970
或者我们考虑将36区到48区进行爆炸泄压
at explosive decompressions in sections 36 through 48.

263
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,220
跳跃引擎呢?
Jump drives?

264
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,200
到此为止了
Then that's it.

265
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,080
这是一种荣誉
It's been an honor.

266
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,420
卡拉狄加  这是帕伽索斯  让我们来助你一臂之力吧
Galactica, Pegasus. Let us take some of this work off your hands.

267
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,340
准备好你们的超光速引擎 其余的就交给我们吧
APOLLO:Get your FTL up and ready and we'll take care of the rest.

268
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,840
准备  主炮开火
All right, fire up that main battery!

269
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,960
收到 长官
MAN: Roger that, sir!

270
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,880
见鬼  李
Damn you, Lee.

271
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,050
继续修复超光速引擎 让他们恢复上线
Keep working on those FTLs! Get 'em online!

272
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,300
是的  长官
Yes, sir!

273
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,640
赛昂人一旦恢复将重新部署
The Cylons will redeploy as soon as they recover.

274
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,020
谢谢你  李
Thank you, Lee.

275
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,100
他们来了 正在包围我们
DUALLA: They're coming about. Maneuvering to bracket us.

276
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,690
稳定航向 穿插到中间去
Steady as she goes. Take us right into the center.

277
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,690
我们那样坚持不了多久的
We won't last long in there.

278
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,820
不
No.

279
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,870
放我下来  放我下来
STARBUCK: Put me down! Put me down!

280
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,910
等等 停下! 放我下来!
Wait! Wait! Stop, stop! Put me down! Put me down!

281
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,250
哇  哇  卡拉  卡拉
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Kara, Kara!

282
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,500
真的是你吗?      宝贝  这真的是我
Is it really you? Yeah. Baby, it's really me,

283
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,920
听我说  我们没有时间了
but listen, we don't have time.

284
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,840
我们现在必须回到船上去 然后离开这该死的鬼星球
We're going to the ships, and we're gonna get the hell off this frakking planet.

285
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,140
好的  凯西在哪
Okay. Where's Kacey?

286
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,640
凯西是谁
Who's Kacey?

287
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,100
凯西  她是我女儿
Kacey. She's my daughter.

288
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,930
卡拉  凯西是谁?
Kara, who's Kacey?

289
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,470
她是我女儿!        卡拉  不  别
She's my daughter! Stop, we gotta... Kara, no!

290
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,520
我不能…
I can't...

291
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,770
该死  卡拉  回来!
Kara! Kara! Gods damn it, Kara, no!

292
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,820
让开 该死  卡拉! 回来
Out of the way! Come on! Gods damn it, Kara, no!

293
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,160
我们已经失去了地面控制权
We've lost control of the situation on the surface.

294
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,240
我们随时可以坐重型突袭机撤离
There's a Heavy Raider standing by, ready to evacuate us.

295
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,540
我们同意 全部撤离
We're agreed. Evacuate the entire facility.

296
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,790
我留下来引爆核弹
I'll stay behind and set off the nuke.

297
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,430
你也应该走  卡布里卡  还有你
You should go as well, Caprica. And you.

298
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,890
我想我们走了以后  你也不会留在这儿吧
I don't think you'll want to be here after we've gone.

299
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,850
我们也给你留了个地方
There's a place for you, too.

300
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,020
给我?
For me?

301
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,310
你是对的  我们错了
Well, you were right and we were wrong.

302
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,940
你应该得到奖励
There should be some reward for that.

303
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,110
盖尤斯  我们一起走吧
Gaius, we should go.

304
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,360
我只是想坐在这里等死
I just want to sit here and die.

305
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,030
你如愿以偿了  盖尤斯
GAETA: You're gonna get your wish, Gaius.

306
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,340
平民飞船正在起飞
KELLY: The ships are getting off the ground.

307
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,260
跳跃离开  只剩几艘了
Jumping away. Only a few left now.

308
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,020
超光速引擎恢复
FTL's back online!

309
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,980
帕伽索斯正遭到连续猛击  长官
Pegasus is taking a hell of a pounding, sir.

310
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,650
它周围好像连一架战机都没有
I don't think she has a single plane in the air.

311
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,900
李把所有战机都派去保护平民飞船了
Lee left all of his planes to guard the civilian ships.

312
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,690
他知道这次买的是单程票  他最终能脱险的
He knew this was a one-way trip. He'll evac before the end.

313
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,860
你确定?    让战机回航!
HELO: You sure? Land our birds!

314
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,080
我们离开这个鬼地方
Let's get the hell out of here!

315
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,080
全体战机 这是卡拉狄加 立即回航
HELO:All wings, Galactica. Come on home.

316
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,250
允许战斗紧急着陆 重复 立即回航
Combat landings authorized. Repeat, come on home!

317
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,170
全体人员 准备跳跃
All hands, all hands! Get ready to jump!

318
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,130
我相信过你
I believed in you.

319
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,260
等等  等等  盖塔
Whoa, whoa, Gaeta.

320
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,930
我相信过那个新卡布里卡的梦
I believed in the dream of New Caprica.

321
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,060
盖塔  我们同样相信过
Gaeta, we all did.

322
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,230
不是!  他没有
No! No. Not him.

323
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,150
他只相信盖尤斯・波塔尔的梦
He believed in the dream of Gaius Baltar.

324
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:58,030
安逸的生活 喝酒  磕药  不停地抓人
The good life. Booze, pills, hot and cold running interns.

325
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,320
他把我们引向灭亡
He led us to the apocalypse

326
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,740
但是我我...只是个...
and I... I turned out to be...

327
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,200
理想主义者
BALTAR: An idealist.

328
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,500
那没有罪
There's no sin in that.

329
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,380
你所描述我的每句话都是事实 每一个字
Everything you say about me is true. Every word.

330
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,100
但你要听我说
But you have to listen to me.

331
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,560
赛昂在这里准备了一枚核弹
The Cylons have a nuke in this complex.

332
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,480
没有任何人能活着离开这颗星球 除非我来阻止它爆炸
Nobody, and I mean nobody, is getting off this planet alive unless I stop D'Anna.

333
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,610
盖尤斯  她会杀了你
Gaius, she'll kill you.

334
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,820
就让她来杀我吧
Then she'll kill me.

335
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,070
要不就让盖塔先生来杀
Or it can be down to Mr. Gaeta.

336
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:45,070
不管谁杀  人类都会和我一起灭亡
Either way, the human race dies with me.

337
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,660
盖尤斯
CAPRICA SIX:Gaius.

338
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,000
继续  开枪吧
Go ahead, shoot.

339
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,920
你还等什么?
What are you waiting for?

340
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,970
请吧
Please. Please.

341
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,470
我求你了...
I'm begging you, please.

342
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,820
你还有机会改变这一切
You have one chance to put things right.

343
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,650
你明白我意思了吗? 
Do you understand me?

344
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,740
快他妈的从这里滚出去  阻止核弹爆炸!快去!
Get the frak out of here! Stop that nuke! Go!

345
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,450
盖尤斯  我们走!
Gaius, let's go!

346
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:37,130
设定主炮按B模式自动循环射击  将引擎定为超速运转
APOLLO: Set main batteries to auto-fire, cycle B. Lock engines ahead flank.

347
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,170
我是指挥官  弃船  弃船
This is the Commander. Abandon ship, abandon ship.

348
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,510
全体人员弃船
All hands, abandon ship.

349
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,180
到猛禽机处报导  跳跃至会合点
Report to evac Raptors and jump to rendezvous point.

350
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,810
干得漂亮  到那里见
Good work, and I'll see you on the other side.

351
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,560
好了  快走  撤离! 我们走!
All right, people, let's move. Out! Let's go!

352
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,820
指挥官  你也快走
You, too, Commander.

353
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,070
是  长官
Yes, sir.

354
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,370
谢谢
Thank you.

355
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,180
凯西!  凯西!
Kacey! Kacey!

356
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,560
凯西!宝贝你在哪儿?
Kacey, honey, where are you?

357
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,860
我就知道你会回来 我已经预见到了
I knew you'd be back. I saw it.

358
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,210
把凯西给我
Come here, Kacey.

359
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,510
说那句话
Say the words.

360
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,430
把她给我    说
Let me take her. Say them.

361
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,680
说什么?
What words?

362
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,140
你知道我想听的那个!
You know what I want.

363
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,930
我想听你亲口对我说出来  而且就像我对你说的那样
I want to hear you say them. And I want the rest of it. Just like I told you.

364
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,820
好吧 你赢了
Fine. You win.

365
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,910
我爱你
I love you.

366
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,590
再说一遍
Say it again.

367
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,930
我爱你
I love you.

368
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,060
那其他的呢?
Now the rest.

369
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,180
这就是你想得到的?
Was it everything you thought it would be?

370
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,680
我永远不会忘记这一刻
That and more. I'll never forget this moment.

371
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,810
我也不会
Neither will I.

372
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,700
以后再解释吧  我们走
I'll explain later. Let's move.

373
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,670
你确定她在里面?
BALTAR: Are you sure she's in there?

374
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,000
肯定在  我看着她进去的
Positive. I saw her go in.

375
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,240
他妈的骗子
Frakking liar.

376
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,470
是她  盖尤斯
It's her, Gaius.

377
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,940
上帝的第一个新子民
The first of God's new generation.

378
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,730
赫拉
Hera.

379
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,450
真是个奇迹
It's a miracle.

380
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,120
是上帝让她活了下来
Gods spared her.

381
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,690
赫拉
Hera.

382
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,150
我能抱抱吗?
Can I hold her?

383
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,500
不行!
CAPRICA SIX: No.

384
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,510
她不会引爆核弹了  再也不会了
She won't set off the nuke. Not anymore.

385
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,840
走吧  盖尤斯  我们该走了
Come on, Gaius, we have to go.

386
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,240
快走   好
Let's go. Go. Okay.

387
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,820
都登舰了
MAN 1: All aboard.

388
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,160
检查前面
MAN 2: Check up front.

389
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,690
我准备好走了
All right. I'm ready to go.

390
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,330
各位  这边走
All right, people, let's go, this way.

391
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,250
请在右舷机库暂时等候 直到我们把你们送去你们的新船上
Stand on the starboard hangar deck till we can get you to new ships.

392
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,630
大家请往这边走
Come on, people, all the way down.

393
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,800
这边  请往这边走  走吧
All the way down, people, all the way down. Let's go!

394
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,840
噢  天呀
Oh, my Gods.

395
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,850
上尉吗?  我还以为你死了呢
Captain? I thought you were dead.

396
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,270
是呀  我也是
Yeah, so did I.

397
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,770
嘿  这是谁?
Anyway, well, who's this?

398
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,690
没错  我也正想问她
Yeah, I was gonna ask that myself.

399
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,730
这是…
STARBUCK: This is...

400
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,020
凯西?
Kacey?

401
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,950
凯西  噢  我的乖女儿
Kacey! My little girl!

402
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,490
妈妈可想死你了

谢谢你 谢谢
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

404
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,000
当赛昂人带走她的时候  我以为...
When the Cylons took her I... I thought...

405
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,250
但你把她救了
But you saved her.

406
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,880
神保佑你
Gods bless you.

407
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,840
嗨
Hey.

408
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,570
谢谢 长官
Thank you, sir.

409
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,860

欢迎登舰
Welcome aboard.

411
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,140
我猜你没看懂我的命令 
I guess you didn't understand my orders.

412
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,060
从来就没看懂过你写的字
Never could read your handwriting.

413
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,020
请求准许登舰  长官
TIGH: Permission to come aboard, sir?

414
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,070
嗨
Hey.

415
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,580
准许登舰
Permission granted.

416
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,300
你做到了 你把他们都带回来了 少
You did it. You brought 'em home, Saul.

417
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,350
但不是所有人
Not all of them.

418
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,060
对不起
I'm sorry.

419
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:26,610
阿达玛!阿达玛!
ALL:Adama! Adama! Adama! Adama!

420
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:30,530
阿达玛!阿达玛!
Adama! Adama! Adama! Adama!

421
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,170
我们仔细检查过了舰队的人员名单
We're still double-checking the Fleet's manifests,

422
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,670
但是玛雅似乎没能逃出新卡布里卡
but it doesn't look like Maya made it off of New Caprica.

423
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,890
婴儿怎么样?
What about the baby?

424
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:46,690
当时我让两个士兵负责把他们带上船
I was there when the two guards left to take them to their ship.

425
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,860
后来怎样我就不知道了
I don't know what happened.

426
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,860
对不起  
I'm so sorry.

427
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,030
我知道我让你失望了
I let you down and I know that.

428
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,830
不  你没有让我失望
No, you didn't.

429
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,870
这不是你的过错
It's not your fault.

430
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,710
这不是我们所能控制的
This is bigger than us.

431
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,890
这就是命运
This is life.

432
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,910
所有飞行员去14号通道报道
