1
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,520
太空堡垒卡拉狄加 【 前情提要 】
STARBUCK: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,610
这颗星球上的海藻足够整个舰队享用
GAETA: There's enough algae on this planet to feed the entire fleet,

3
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,530
不过该星系中的一颗恒星极其不稳定
but the star in the system is highly unstable.

4
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,280
说出来您也许不信 它处于变成超新星的边缘
If you can believe it, on the verge of going supernova.

5
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,370
我们刚发现四艘赛昂基地之星高速袭来
TIGH: We just picked up four baseships inbound at high speed.

6
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,620
赛昂人发现
ADAMA: It's just a matter of time

7
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,450
我们来此的意图只是时间问题
until the Cylons find out what we're up to on this planet.

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,630
星芭坠机了
DUALLA: Starbuck has gone down!

9
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,380
我要去救我的妻子!
I am going after my wife!

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,720
不行 山姆    我用不着让你同意
I can't let you do that, Sam. I am not asking you for permission.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,430
马赛厄斯中士
Sergeant Mathias.

12
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,680
如果我告诉你 你的女儿还尚在人间呢
BOOMER: What if I told you that your daughter was still alive?

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,470
你说谎    她现在就在我们的基地之星上
I'd say you were lying. She's on our baseship right now.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,770
她病了 而我们不知道是何原因
She's ill, and we don't know why.

15
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,390
我说不清自己怎么找到这个地方的
TYROL: I don't even know how I found this place.

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,690
我就是想向前走 然后突然就到了这里
I just got this urge to start walking, and then suddenly here it is.

17
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,940
依经文上所述 这间神庙是
The scriptures say that this Temple is the final resting place

18
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,190
朱庇特之眼的最终所在地
of the Eye of Jupiter.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,990
到底是什么意思?
What exactly are we talking about?

20
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,320
那是第13部落所留下的标记 
It's a marker that was left behind by the Thirteenth Tribe.

21
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,410
它可以指明到达地球的道路
It's supposed to point the way to Earth.

22
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,160
我们要"朱庇特之眼"
We want the Eye of Jupiter.

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,920
胆敢攻击这艘战舰或那颗星球上我的手下
Make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planet's surface,

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,080
我就把全部的核弹发射出去
I'll launch every nuke I've got.

25
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,960
少校 在轮机长找到"朱庇特之眼"以前 
ADAMA: Major, you've got to hold off the Cylons

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,920
你一定要拖住赛昂人
until Chief finds the Eye of Jupiter.

27
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,130
如果他们要进入神庙 你的命令就是摧毁它
If it looks like they're gonna get into the Temple, your order is to blow it.

28
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,550
我们必须去那颗星球 
We have to go down to the planet.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,100
我就快看到最后五个赛昂人的样子了
I am so close to seeing the faces of the last five Cylons.

30
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,970
只有进入神庙的人 才能看到"终极五人"
HYBRID: The Final Five, revealed only to those who enter the Temple.

31
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,770
只有被神选中的人才能看到 被神选中的人才能看到
Only to the Chosen One... The Chosen One...

32
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,730
我们刚发现六艘重型突袭机向那颗星球飞去
We just picked up six Heavy Raiders heading down toward the planet.

33
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,860
地面核打击导弹预备
Order nuclear ground-strike missiles.

34
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,940
我不会让赛昂人拿到"朱庇特之眼"
I'm not gonna let the Cylons get their hands on the Eye.

35
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,450
我们是要牺牲李吗?
ROSLIN: Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee?

36
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,740
上将  导弹已装载完毕
Missiles are loaded, Admiral.

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,580
批准使用核武器
Release of nuclear weapons is now authorized.

38
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,300
盖塔先生
Mr. Gaeta.

39
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,890
解除四到十号管道的核弹发射保险
Disable launch and warhead safeties on tubes 4 through 10.

40
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,520
保险已解除 核弹待命
Safeties disabled. Warheads are armed.

41
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,440
副官
XO,

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,570
请输入你的发射码
please input your firing code.

43
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,280
这些核弹将把神庙周围方圆20里范围夷为平地
These nukes will obliterate anything or anyone within 20 clicks of the Temple.

44
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,740
我知道
ADAMA: I know.

45
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,950
他真要动手了 立即召回突袭机
LEOBEN: He's gonna do it. Recall the Raiders immediately.

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,960
我们赞成 让他们回来
We agree. Bring them back.

47
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,290
我们赞成 到了这个地步 
We agree. After all this time,

48
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,460
我们无法承担失去这一切的后果
we can't afford to lose everything.

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,840
我们同意 让他们回来
We agree. Bring them back.

50
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,930
如果卡拉死了 我对天发誓 我会亲自要了你的命
If Kara dies out there, I swear to Gods, I will kill you myself.

51
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,600
如果她真的死了 悉听尊便
If she dies out there, I'll let you.

52
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,240
那我们现在要做什么?  拿把枪跟着我?
So, what are we gonna do now, follow me around with a gun?

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,070
就因为只有这样 才能阻止我去救卡拉?
Because that is the only way that I am not going after Kara.

54
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,700
列兵塞克斯    在  长官
Private Sykes. Sir?

55
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,830
联系杜亚拉中尉
Get Lieutenant Dualla on the line.

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,290
是  长官
Yes, sir.

57
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,170
我在
I'm here.

58
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,630
发现星芭的所在地了吗?
APOLLO: Do you have eyeballs on Starbuck's position?

59
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,880
没有 我们没发现星芭的猛禽机
Negative. We have no visual on her Raptor,

60
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,010
不过可以看到坠机点升起的黑烟
but I can see smoke from the crash site.

61
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,550
她在几里外的山后坠毁的
She went down behind a hill a couple clicks away.

62
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,050
能够到达她的猛禽机那里吗?
Can you get to the Raptor?

63
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,890
不知道 很远  掩体很少
I don't know. It's pretty far away. There's minimal cover.

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,220
可行吗?
Is it doable?

65
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,310
不知道
I don't know.

66
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,980
钥匙
Key.

67
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,160
待命
Standing by.

68
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,370
发射次序设为自动
Launch sequence set to auto.

69
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,040
他们同我们一样 也想取得找到地球的钥匙
D'ANNA: They want the key to finding Earth as much as we do.

70
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,500
他不会一手毁掉它的
He won't just destroy it.

71
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,380
我们已讨论过了 已做出了决定
We spoke, and the decision's been made.

72
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,510
按我口令发射
Fire on my mark.

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,980
长官  突袭机返回了
Sir, the Raiders are turning back.

74
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,190
并非全部 更正 五架突袭机返回了
Not all of them. Correction. Five have turned back.

75
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,110
仍有一架向那颗星球飞去
One is still en route back to the planet.

76
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,200
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

77
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,660
他不会因为一艘飞船而发射核弹的
He won't launch against just one ship.

78
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,580
不会的    问题不在这里 
He won't. That's not the issue.

79
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,500
我们已做出了决定 戴・安娜必须撤回
We made a decision. D'Anna has to turn back.

80
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
不
No.

81
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,500
通知戴・安娜和波塔尔 
CAPRICA SIX: Call D'Anna and Baltar.

82
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,970
让他们立即撤回    不
Turn them around now. D'ANNA: No!

83
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,050
"不"是什么意思?
What do you mean, no?

84
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,390
我们必须这么做
This is something that we have to do.

85
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,600
他不会为一艘飞船而发射核弹的 你们看着吧
He won't launch over one ship. You'll see.

86
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,480
你想让我...
You want me...

87
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,400
你想让我营救瑟瑞丝上尉?
You want me to rescue Captain Thrace?

88
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,070
设法营救
Attempt the rescue.

89
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,320
是  长官
Yes, sir.

90
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,030
狐火通话完毕
Foxfire One out.

91
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,870
走吧
We go.

92
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,080
上将  武器仍在待命
TIGH: Weapons are still hot, Admiral.

93
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,580
收回导弹  关闭发射口
Safe all missiles. Close outer doors.

94
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,510
看到了吗?
There. You see?

95
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,270
他绝不会因小失大
Never over just one ship.

96
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,770
这可不是一个好兆头  朋友们
That is not a good sign, my friends.

97
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,610
她违抗我们  违抗组织
She defied us, defied the group.

98
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,660
我们的问题已不是"朱庇特之眼"了  而是她
LEOBEN: It's not about the Eye of Jupiter. It's about her.

99
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,830
她仿佛与我们形同陌路了一样
It's like we don't even know them anymore.

100
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,250
我们必须要对此采取一些措施
We may have to do something about this.

101
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,790
迟早都要采取一些措施
We may have to do it sooner than later.

102
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,800
赫拉还活着 我是她的母亲  我要去找她
Hera's alive. I'm her mother, and I'm going to get her.

103
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,300
莎伦  宝贝 听我说
Sharon, baby, listen to me, okay?

104
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,930
我们可以驾驶猛禽机 单独去赛昂母舰
We can take a Raptor. We can fly to the baseship ourselves.

105
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,310
我不在乎了
I don't... I don't care anymore.

106
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,140
行不通
We can't.

107
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,820
那我们再想办法 会有办法的
We'll find another way. We will.

108
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,200
没其他的路可走了
There is no other way.

109
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,040
别让我这么做  莎伦
Don't ask me to do this, Sharon.

110
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,960
听我说
Listen to me.

111
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,800
一直以来 你都是铮铮硬汉
You have always been the strong one.

112
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,850
当所有人都不相信我们能长相厮守的时候 你相信
You believed in us when no one else would.

113
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,650
我求你了
I'm begging you to do this.

114
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,120
鼓起勇气 为了我们两个人  好吗?
Find the courage to do this for both of us, okay?

115
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,300
我爱你
I love you.

116
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,300
我也爱你
I love you, too.

117
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,070
到外面等    是  长官
Wait outside. Yes, sir.

118
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,240
莎伦正下载到
ROSLIN: Sharon's downloading into another body

119
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,120
赛昂母舰上的一副新躯体里吧?
aboard a Cylon ship right now, isn't she?

120
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,290
她求我的
She begged me.

121
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,330
是她求我那么做的
She begged me to do it.

122
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,960
天啊  如果你...
Gods, if you'd...

123
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,590
当时看到她的那双眼睛--        她持有关于…
Seen the look in her eyes when I... She has important information

124
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,180
我们防御体系的重要情报 密码  程序
on our defenses. Codes, procedures,

125
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,930
以及那颗星球上的战术布局
the tactical situation down on the planet's surface.

126
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,440
这些赛昂人也都得到了
The Cylons have access to all of that as well.

127
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,480
她不会背叛我们
She won't betray us.

128
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,690
这您清楚
You know that.

129
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,440
所以您才给她制服的
It's why you gave her the uniform.

130
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,860
她可能身不由己 这你考虑过吗?
She may not have a choice. Did you consider that?

131
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,410
她说过她会反抗 不会泄露军情
She says she could resist, that she wouldn't let it happen.

132
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,700
她找到赫拉后
She'll get Hera,

133
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,370
就会回来
and she'll come back.

134
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,340
好个信任度的提升  上尉
That's quite a leap of faith you've made, there, Captain.

135
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,010
如果只有你的家庭承担风险 我会赞扬你的勇敢
And if it involved your family only, I'd say it was brave.

136
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,140
但你是在以整个舰队冒险 你知道吗?
But you've put the entire fleet in jeopardy, are you aware of that?

137
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,060
如果不是你先说谎...
If you hadn't lied

138
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,860
然后偷走我们的孩子...
and stolen our baby in the first place,

139
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,990
我们也就不至于到此地步
we wouldn't be here at all.

140
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,260
让大家落到此种境遇 我的确负有责任
I've certainly played my part in bringing us to this moment.

141
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,930
我会承担诸多的责难与过失
And there's plenty of blame to throw around, and I accept it.

142
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,940
现在我们所有人的性命 都掌握在莎伦・阿格森的手中
And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon.

143
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,570
我们只能希望你的妻子 
All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy

144
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,030
不会辜负你对她无条件的信任
of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain.

145
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,450
以及您对她的信任  上将
And you as well, Admiral.

146
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,430
出了什么事?
Can you tell me what happened?

147
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,810
他们不让我见我的女儿
They wouldn't let me see my daughter,

148
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,150
所以我丈夫杀了我
so my husband shot me.

149
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,770
只能如此
It was the only way.

150
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,740
一切都已经过去了
Well, it's over now.

151
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,490
重要的是你在这里
The important thing is that you're here.

152
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,620
我女儿怎么样了?
How's my daughter?

153
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,330
病情加重了
She's getting worse.

154
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,500
我要去见她
I want to see her.

155
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,040
然后呢?
And then what?

156
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,130
他们对我所做的一切...
What they did to me,

157
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,010
偷走我的孩子...
stealing my baby

158
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,720
然后告诉我她已经死了...
and telling me she was dead...

159
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,390
都被你说中了
You proved it.

160
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,560
赫拉在这里是安全的
Hera's safer here,

161
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,980
我也一样
and so am I.

162
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,570
在她坠机之前...
All right, before she went down,

163
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,820
星芭发现 多于15个"整容人"正向我方行进
Starbuck spotted about 15-plus chrome jobs advancing on us from here.

164
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,780
要到我们这里 这条峡谷是"烤面包机"们的必经之路
To get to us, the toasters have to come through this canyon.

165
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,490
这里是天然的阻塞点
This is a natural choke point.

166
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,580
我们就在这里埋伏它们
That's where we'll ambush them,

167
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,950
打游击战
guerilla style.

168
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,250
我们的任务是把守这里的神庙
Our mission is to hold the Temple here.

169
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,830
如果任务失败 我们就炸毁它
If we fail, we blow it up.

170
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,500
然后撤退到这些会合点
We fall back to these rendezvous points.

171
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,420
然后进山  等待救援
And then we head into the mountains, and we wait for rescue.

172
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,800
和别处一样 这里也是上西天的好地方
Well, it's a good a place as any to die, I suppose.

173
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,100
怎么样?
What do you think?

174
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,600
散步的好天气
It's a nice day for a walk.

175
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,740
狙击手!
DUALLA: Sniper!

176
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,160
小心点  费希尔
Hey, take it easy, Fischer.

177
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,410
中士?
Sarge?

178
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,950
中士?
Sarge?

179
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,770
真伤脑筋  好好想想
This is crazy. Come on, think, think.

180
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,110
加伦  阿达玛少校打来的
Galen, it's Major Adama.

181
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,940
长官
Sir.

182
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,530
轮机长  我们就位了
APOLLO: Chief, we're in position.

183
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,860
找到"朱庇特之眼"了吗?
Any luck finding the Eye of Jupiter?

184
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,490
没有  少校 我还需要时间
No, Major. I need more time.

185
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,700
找吧  赛昂人行动了 
Get on it. The Cylons are on the move.

186
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,620
我们尽量拖延它们
We'll hold them off as long as we can.

187
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,120
阿波罗通话完毕
Apollo out.

188
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,880
各位听好 收拾好装备  准备撤退
All right, listen up! Pack your gear, get ready to move!

189
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,460
明白    好的
MAN 1: I've got this. WOMAN: All right.

190
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,300
轮机长 我们撤吧
MAN 2: Hey, Chief, let's get out of here.

191
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,970
近在咫尺 我知道
It's so close. I know.

192
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,720
你所有问题的答案就在下面的神庙中
The answers to all your questions are down there in that temple.

193
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,350
怎么了?
What's wrong?

194
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,140
我有些担心  盖尤斯
I'm worried, Gaius.

195
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,030
我们一直以来就在等待这个时刻
This is what we've been waiting for.

196
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,150
你是神所选派的
You are the anointed one.

197
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,240
你是去观看"终极五人"的人选
Chosen by God to look on the faces of the Final Five Cylons.

198
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,750
一切都是上苍注定的
It's already written.

199
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,830
你会成功的
You will succeed.

200
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,330
我怕的就是这事
That's what I'm afraid of.

201
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,840
看到神的面孔 必会走向疯狂
To know the face of God is to know madness.

202
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,720
"混合体"所看到的空间是生死之间
The Hybrid has looked into the space between life and death,

203
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,260
她可以看到我们无法察觉到的事情
and she's seen things that we cannot conceive of,

204
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,970
而结果却落得疯疯癫癫的下场
but she's been driven mad as a result.

205
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,810
相信神
Have faith in God.

206
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,560
把你的性命交给他
Put your life in his hands.

207
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,230
他会指引你去完成你的宿命
He will guide you to your destiny.

208
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,580
我很感激你...
I'm grateful to you.

209
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,410
为我所做的一切
For everything.

210
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,460
你们两人的宿命将分道扬镳 盖尤斯
Her destiny will part company from yours, Gaius.

211
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,630
她不是被神所选中的 而你是
She's not the Chosen One. You are.

212
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,550
是  我知道
Yes, I know.

213
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,670
我知道
I know.

214
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,440
准备?    拿到了 
Ready? I got it.

215
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,030
我们准备好了 现在就守株待兔了
APOLLO: Okay, we're set. And now we wait.

216
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,540
如果少校的如意算盘落空了怎么办?
What happens if the Cylons don't dance to the Major's tune?

217
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,920
如果我们被逼得分开了怎么办?
What happens is we get splattered all over these rocks.

218
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,540
闭嘴  这是他的战术 不是我们的
Shut up. This is his game, not ours.

219
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,220
我们按他说的去做 也许可以脱身
We just do what we're told, and maybe we get out of here.

220
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,680
这些民兵真能阻止它们吗?
You really think these civvies can stop them?

221
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,600
我们还在逃命的时候 他们在卡布里卡上就做到了
Well, they stopped plenty of them on Caprica while we were running for our lives.

222
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,440
三位"破铜烂铁" 已进入我们的杀伤区了
Okay, three clankers just entered our kill zone.

223
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,570
肯定是它们的侦察兵
Gotta be their recon element.

224
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,780
塞克斯 给他们信号
Sykes, give them the signal.

225
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,000
好  大显身手的时候到了
All right, showtime, showtime.

226
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
它们向我们这边来了
All right, they're headed our way.

227
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,560
等到它们都进来以后再引爆
Don't detonate till they're all the way in.

228
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,460
等待
Wait for it.

229
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,710
来吧  混蛋  来啊
Come on, you sons of bitches. Come on.

230
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,630
快  快
Now, now, now, now.

231
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,020
小心!
Look out!

232
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,270
有人负伤!
Man down!

233
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,080
停火!  它们撤退了!
Cease fire! They're pulling back! They're pulling back!

234
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,420
干!
Frak!

235
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,210
天杀的!
Gods damn it!

236
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,630
过来!
APOLLO: Come on!

237
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,590
见鬼
Damn it.

238
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,220
妈的
Frak, frak.

239
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,510
人已经死了 我们得把他拉回来
Okay, this man's dead. We gotta pull him back.

240
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,720
山姆  振作
Sam, pull it together.

241
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,530
我们争取到了一些时间
APOLLO: All right, we bought ourselves a little time,

242
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,320
不过它们会带重兵回来
but they'll be back and with force,

243
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,860
找好掩体
so dig in.

244
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,780
我们要拖住它们 直到轮机长找到"朱庇特之眼"
We'll need to hold them off until Chief finds the Eye.

245
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,660
注意那些山脊地带
And keep your eyes out on those ridges.

246
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,340
有卡拉或小杜的消息吗?
You have any word from Kara or Dee?

247
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,090
没有
No.

248
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,850
星芭?  
Starbuck?

249
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,440
星…
Star...

250
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,190
小杜  你怎么那么大声 
Dee, why the hell didn't you sing out?

251
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,150
我差点把你干掉
I almost blew you away.

252
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,280
我也很高兴见到你
Glad to see you, too.

253
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,530
好  好 
Okay, okay.

254
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,290
没关系
It's okay, yeah.

255
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,470
李派你来的?
Lee sent you?

256
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,600
恩
Yep.

257
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,180
我丈夫...
My husband

258
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,520
命令我冒着生命危险来救你
ordered me to risk my life for yours.

259
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,690
我要来救你
That's what I'm gonna do.

260
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,520
要把星芭带回去见阿波罗
I'm gonna bring Starbuck back to Apollo.

261
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,820
她在这里
She's here.

262
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,220
是我啊
It's me.

263
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,180
我是妈妈
It's Mommy. Yes.

264
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,890
怎么了?
What's wrong?

265
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,850
我们什么方法都试过了 也不见起色
We tried everything. She didn't respond.

266
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,230
看啊 赫拉认识她
Look at that. Hera knows her.

267
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,730
好神奇 你们俩在生理上毫无二致
That's amazing. You and she are biologically identical.

268
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,820
而赫拉却认出了她的母亲
But Hera recognizes her mother.

269
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,540
这就好  你留着她吧 我可受够了
Well, good, because you can have her. I'm done with her.

270
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,830
这不是你的真心话
You don't mean that.

271
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,870
我知道你还是在乎蒂罗尔和阿达玛的
I know you still care about Tyrol and Adama.

272
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,750
不
No.

273
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,050
那样的日子已经一去不返了
I'm done with that part of my life.

274
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,380
这是我在新卡布里卡上学到的
I learnt that on New Caprica.

275
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,430
人类与赛昂人 命中注定就不该在一起
Humans and Cylons were not meant to be together.

276
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,060
我们就应该各走各的路
We should just go our separate ways.

277
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,310
躺下吧
Wanna lay down?

278
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,900
她的肚子好硬 你们之前注意到了吗?
Her belly's as hard as a rock. Have you noticed that before?

279
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,490
能是什么事?
What do you think that means?

280
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,950
可能是肠阻塞
Blocked intestine, maybe.

281
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,870
我们的医生给她做过体检
Our doctors examined her.

282
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,250
你们的医生从没给幼儿做过体检
Well, your doctors have never examined a child.

283
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,920
要让人类的医生给赫拉看病
Hera needs to be seen by a human doctor.

284
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,590
我得带她回卡拉狄加
I need to take her back to Galactica.

285
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,640
你明知这是不可能的   你也清楚这孩子对我们何等重要
You know that can't happen, what this child means to us.

286
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,560
对每一个赛昂人有多重要
What she means to every living Cylon.

287
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,270
我早该料到 这一切都是她计划好了的
I should have known. She's been planning this all along.

288
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,650
你亲自去摸摸她
Feel her.

289
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,160
没错
She's right.

290
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,910
她的肚子确实很硬
Belly's as hard as a gourd.

291
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,700
如果你不让我带她走 新生代的第一人就会死掉
If you don't let me take her, the first of a new generation will die.

292
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,960
神永远也不会宽恕你
God will never forgive you.

293
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,960
也许还是卡维尔说得对
Maybe Cavil's right.

294
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,050
可能神从一开始 就没想让我们拥有孩子
Maybe God never wanted us to have children in the first place.

295
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,340
或许为了你好 我应该扭断你的小脖子
Maybe it'd be better for you if I just snapped your little neck!

296
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,100
不要
Don't!

297
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,310
求你...
Please.

298
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,440
求你不要杀害我的小女儿
Please don't kill my baby girl.

299
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,870
宝贝
Honey!

300
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,130
我相信这孩子决定着赛昂人的未来
I believe the future of the Cylon rests with this child,

301
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,930
其他人还会来加害她
and the others who are gonna come after her.

302
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,550
我想也是
So do I.

303
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
舰上有一艘捕获的猛禽机
There's a captured Raptor aboard.

304
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,020
走吧
Let's go.

305
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,770
我们得送你回卡拉狄加
We've gotta get you back to Galactica.

306
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,580
它们来了
Here they come.

307
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,000
开火!
Open fire!

308
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,420
通知他们把那东西炸了 
Tell them to blow the thing!

309
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,550
赛昂人逼近了
The Cylons are closing in!

310
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,430
少校打来的
It's the Major.

311
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,180
蒂罗尔 找到"朱庇特之眼"了吧?
Tyrol. Tell me you've found the Eye of Jupiter.

312
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,430
还没  不过快了
No, but I'm getting close, Major.

313
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,930
我又认出了一些字
I've deciphered some more of the glyphs.

314
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,501
有一处提到"眼睛" 
I got a reference to an eye, 

315
00:25:25,502 --> 00:25:28,020
还提到了"恒星"  "爆炸"什么的
something about a star, and an explosion of some kind.

316
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,520
长话短说  轮机长
All right, cut to the chase, Chief.

317
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,070
你是否拿到了"朱庇特之眼"?
Do you have the Eye of Jupiter in your hands or not?

318
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,530
没有  少校
No, Major.

319
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,820
它来了
That's it!

320
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,030
开火了
It's hot!

321
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,710
好了  轮机长 听我说  到此结束
All right, Chief, listen to me. That's it!

322
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,710
带你的人去会合点 然后炸毁神庙
Get your people to the rally point and blow the Temple.

323
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,710
重复一遍  炸毁神庙
I repeat, blow the Temple.

324
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,340
是  长官  该死
Yes, sir. Damn it.

325
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,720
撤退! 
All right, fall back!

326
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,680
塞克斯 马赛厄斯 撤退!
Sykes, Mathias, fall back!

327
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,930
撤退!  撤退!
Fall back! Fall back!

328
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,980
好了  就这样了 各位  放下手里的活  撤退
All right, that's it, everybody. Drop what you're doing and get out.

329
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,980
拿到了    好 接这个
MAN 1: I've got this. MAN 2: All right, take that one.

330
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,810
你也一样  凯莉
That means you, too, Cally. Come on!

331
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,650
好吧 带上那个绳…
MAN 1: Okay, bring the cord...

332
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,480
把装备丢下!  快走!
TYROL: Leave the gear! Go!

333
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,490
走    拿好了
MAN 2: Go. WOMAN: I've got it.

334
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,330
再给我一点时间就好了    加伦
If I only had a little more time. Galen.

335
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,000
一切都随天意吧 走吧  
It's in the hands of the Gods now, okay? Let's go.

336
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,830
我们无能为力了
There's nothing we can do!

337
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,600
船体完好    好
The ship's structurally intact. Okay.

338
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,310
这也就是说我们飞不起来的原因出自遥控自动驾驶仪
That means that the only thing keeping us grounded is a busted fly-by wire.

339
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,520
所以...
So...

340
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,070
你得绕开那捆线  用通讯系统中的数据线形成旁路
You gotta bypass those bundles with data cord from the com system.

341
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,610
这样我们...
And then we...

342
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,530
我们兴许有逃出升天的机会
We may have a shot at getting out of here.

343
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,300
只剩一支了
There's only one left.

344
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,060
最好留着等你驾机  让我们脱离险境后再用
Better save it for when you fly us out of here.

345
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,560
我驾驶不了
I can't fly.

346
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,190
特别是打了吗啡后  我都头晕目眩的了
Especially all whacked up on morph.

347
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,690
这下可真他妈的好
Well, that's just frakking great.

348
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,400
他不会骗你的
He won't cheat.

349
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,030
他还是很诚实
He's too honorable.

350
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,490
不像你
Unlike you.

351
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,410
对  不像我
Yeah, unlike me.

352
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,540
我爱山姆  我恨山姆
I love Sam. I hate Sam.

353
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,130
我爱李  我恨李
I love Lee. I hate Lee.

354
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,760
天呐  我非得骗来骗去 才能保证不露马脚
Gods, I have to cheat just to keep the pieces all nice and neat.

355
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,640
打起精神
Stay with it.

356
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,520
你还得教我 怎么连接这些航空元件
You still gotta walk me through these avionics.

357
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,400
赛昂人已经到达神庙了 轮机长  你那边情况如何?
APOLLO: The Cylons have reached the Temple. Chief, what's your status?

358
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,730
我正在连接最后一个引爆器
I'm wiring the last detonator.

359
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,650
"朱庇特之眼" 一定就在这间神庙里的某个地方
D'ANNA: The Eye of Jupiter has to be somewhere in this Temple.

360
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,870
他们安上了炸药
CAVIL: They've wired it with explosives.

361
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,750
我们去拆下来
Let's disconnect it.

362
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,460
把引爆器拔出来 快
Pull out the detonators. Quickly.

363
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,930
轮机长  炸掉它!
APOLLO: Chief, blow this thing!

364
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,640
你他妈的疯了吗?
You out of your frakking mind?

365
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,930
我下不了手
I can't do it.

366
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,980
盖尤斯!        什么事?
Gaius! Yes?

367
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,230
来帮忙!
Help us!

368
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,360
好
Yeah.

369
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,820
把控制器给我
Give me the control!

370
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,370
这样就行了
This just about does it.

371
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,090
干!
Frak!

372
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,210
看你做的好事!  看你做的好事!
What have you done? What have you done?

373
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,680
少校  你看
Major, look.

374
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,510
那是什么东西?
What is that?

375
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,770
在那里  盖尤斯 
There it is, Gaius.

376
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,530
你所有问题的答案就在那里
It has the answers to all of your questions.

377
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,450
那就是"朱庇特之眼"?
That's the Eye?

378
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,620
那是什么?
D'ANNA: What is?

379
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,700
哦 呃…
Oh, uh...

380
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,660
"混合体"曾说过...
Something the Hybrid said...

381
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,580
宝石蓝…
Sapphire blue

382
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,630
像一颗恒星一样发光
shining like unto a star.

383
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,170
戴・安娜
D'Anna...

384
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,590
你来这里不是为了寻找地球 
You didn't come here looking for Earth.

385
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,470
而是别有用心
You came here looking for something else.

386
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,310
从中心星那里收到巨大能量脉冲
Picking up massive energy pulse from the central star.

387
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,560
长官 那是氦闪 那颗恒星要变成超新星了
Sir, it's a helium flash. The star's going nova.

388
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:25,190
超新星将在不到一个小时内 扫平整个星球
Nova's gonna obliterate the entire planet in less than an hour.

389
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,200
少校  看
Major, look.

390
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,830
那是神庙里的曼荼罗 
It's the mandala from the Temple.

391
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,330
就应该是这样
This is supposed to be happening.

392
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,700
就是这样 
That's it.

393
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,290
原来它一直近在眼前
I was staring at it the whole time.

394
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,880
那颗太阳要变成超新星了
The sun is going nova.

395
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,210
那颗超新星就是"朱庇特之眼"
The nova is the Eye of Jupiter.

396
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,010
好  我们还能炸掉它 我们去把它炸掉
All right, we can still blow it. We can still blow it.

397
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,690
只要能到轨道上就行 卡拉狄加会在那里找到我们 好吗?
We just gotta make it into orbit. Galactica will find us from there, okay?

398
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,360
好
Okay.

399
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,900
好
Good.

400
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,820
这是我的宿命
This is my destiny.

401
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,750
去见证是什么存在于生死之间
To see what lies between life and death.

402
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,960
还有去看"终极五人"的样子
And to look upon the faces of the Final Five.

403
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,290
不行
That can't happen.

404
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,300
这是我的宿命
This is my destiny.

405
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,180
对不起了  戴・安娜
Sorry, D'Anna.

406
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,150
"终极五人"
The Final Five.

407
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,860
真的是你们
Is it really you?

408
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,600
是你...
You.

409
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,100
原谅我的有眼无珠
Forgive me, I... I had no idea.

410
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,120
什么有眼无珠?
No idea about what?

411
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
你看到了什么?
What did you see? What...

412
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,290
是谁?
Who was it?

413
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,510
好美
So beautiful...

414
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,430
什么好美?
What was?

415
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,180
告诉我 我是你们中的一员吗?
Tell me! Am I one of you?

416
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,760
你说对了
You were right.

417
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,810
什么说对了?
About what?

418
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,180
戴・安娜 你看到我了吗?
D'Anna, did you see my face?

419
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,560
我必须得知道  求你了
I have to know, please.

420
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,560
求你了  振作  我必须得知道
Please, stay with me. Stay, I have to know!

421
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,530
告诉我!  我必须得知道!  你看到我了吗?
Tell me, I have to know! Did you see my face?

422
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,450
我是赛昂人吗?
Am I a Cylon?

423
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,490
妈的
Frak.

424
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,590
神啊  在我死前告诉我真相
God, tell me the truth before I die.

425
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,300
欢迎回家  总统阁下
Welcome home, Mr. President.

426
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,900
上将  赛昂舰队跳跃走了
Admiral, the Cylon fleet just jumped away.

427
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,740
他们不想被那颗超新星波及到
They don't wanna be here when that nova shock front gets here.

428
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,900
我们也不想
Neither do we.

429
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,450
立即展开营救行动
Launch a rescue mission, now.

430
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,740
超新星会把系统里的部件都烧掉 我们时间不多了
We don't have much time before the nova fries everything in the system.

431
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,490
与时间赛跑
It's gonna be a photo finish.

432
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,570
救援船清点完毕!
HOSHI: All rescue ships from the planet accounted for.

433
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,030
倒数计时!
Count us down!

434
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,450
启动超光速引擎    启动超光速引擎
Commence FTL. HOSHI: Commencing FTL.

435
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,070
三 二 一
GAETA: Jump in three, two, one...

436
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,100
我来吧
I got it.

437
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,240
他还没死?        可惜还没死
He's not dead? No, unfortunately.

438
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,040
关他禁闭
Take him to the brig.

439
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,220
莎伦
Sharon!

440
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,270
你好
Hi.

441
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,400
必须把她马上送到科特尔医生那里
We have to get her to Doc Cottle right away.

442
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,610
好吗    好的
Okay? Okay.

443
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,320
举枪!
Stick up!

444
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,740
别开枪  别开枪
Hold your fire! Hold your fire.

445
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,830
她帮我们逃出来的    让开!
She helped us escape. Get out of the way!

446
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,370
中尉
Lieutenant.

447
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,870
莎伦
Sharon...

448
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,860
轮机长说得对
I think the Chief is right.

449
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,780
那颗超新星确实像是神庙内的曼陀缴
I think the nova does look like the mandala inside of this Temple.

450
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,750
你说当时的第13部落 料到会发生什么事了吗?
Do you think the Thirteenth Tribe had a vision of what was to come?

451
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,000
我看不出它还代表什么?
I don't know what else it could mean.

452
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,880
可能他们那时也看到了一颗超新星  然后画了下来
Maybe they saw another nova, and drew a picture of that.

453
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,920
看过一颗超新星  其他的都一样
You've seen one nova, you've seen them all.

454
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,090
确实还有一颗超新星
Well, there was another nova.

455
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,640
4000年前在这里出现的  大约在神庙刚落成时
Seen 4,000 years ago, around about when the Temple might have been built.

456
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,940
距离我们当前位置有13000光年
It's 13,000 light years from our present position.

457
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,110
被称为爱奥尼亚星云的一团气体
It's a cloud of gas known as the lonian Nebula.

458
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,240
那可能就是...
Maybe it was a road sign

459
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,950
显示他们去向的路标
showing the direction that they headed to next.

460
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,330
星芭 像你一样 
So, Starbuck, is that what you gotta do

461
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,710
就可以躺在床上多休息一会了吗?
to get a little actual rack time around here?

462
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,500
你来这里是和我扯皮的吗?
Did you just come by to frak with me?

463
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,670
我其实是来问你...
Actually, I wanted to know if you had any...

464
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,630
是否有以前 你在卡布里卡上的家的照片的
pictures of your old apartment on Caprica.

465
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,890
嗯
Um...

466
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,470
有哇
Yeah. Uh...

467
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,850
那个柜子最上层的雪茄盒里
The locker, top shelf. Cigar box.

468
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,440
为什么问我这事?
Why?

469
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,940
有些好奇
I'm curious about something.

470
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,030
但愿你和莎伦  不是打算要重新装修
Well, I hope you and Sharon aren't planning on redecorating,

471
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:31,660
因为从我原来的住处那里  你们可得不到任何灵感
'cause you're not gonna get any bright ideas from my old place.

472
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,120
这我记得
I remember.

473
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,120
我看火车失事后的残骸都比你那里强
I've seen better looking train wrecks.

474
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,540
过奖了
Thank you.

475
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,120
你还记得你作的那些画吗?
But I do remember those paintings you did.

476
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,300
那些画怎么了?
STARBUCK: What about them?

477
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:08,230
这是神庙里的图案
This was on the Temple.

478
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,070
你的画从哪里得来的灵感?
Where'd you get the idea to paint yours?

479
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,700
不知道
I don't know.

480
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,280
我从小就那么乱涂了  
It was just something I've been doodling since I was a kid.

481
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,240
我喜欢那个图案
I liked the pattern.

482
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,120
呃…
Well...

483
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,880
他们在4000年前建造的神庙
They built the Temple 4,000 years ago.

484
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,460
怎么了?
What is it?

485
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,010
李・奥本有一次曾说过...
Just something Leoben said once.

486
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,850
我有我的宿命
That I had a destiny.

487
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,530
一切都已是命中注定
That it had already been written.

488
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,710
你知道规矩
You know the drill.

489
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,880
长吸一口气  匀速深呼吸
Long, deep, controlled breathing.

490
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,140
至少你不会再受这个苦了
At least you'll never have to go through this again.

491
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:21,220
做出这个决定并不容易 但这个结局是不可避免的
The decision wasn't easy, but the conclusion was inevitable.

492
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,730
你的型号有先天性的缺陷
Your model is fundamentally flawed.

493
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,520
不
No.

494
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,320
去寻问我们存在的意义 并不是一种缺陷
It's not a flaw to question our purpose.

495
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,530
不是吗?
Is it?

496
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,830
想知道是谁  为什么创造了我们  让我们拥有这样的思维方式
To wonder who programmed us, the way we think and why?

497
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,950
这恰恰就是问题所在
Well, that's the problem right there.

498
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,420
弥塞亚罪名是 你肩负特殊使命来指点我们
The messianic conviction that you're on a special mission to enlighten us.

499
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,420
看看它为我们所带来的危害
Look at the damage it's caused.

500
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,380
如果再给我一次机会我还会那么做的
I would do it all again.

501
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,550
恩  我们知道
Yes, we know.

502
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,170
所以我们已决定...
That's why we've decided to

503
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,090
把你的型号雪藏
box your entire line.

504
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:01,810
你的意识  记忆…  你这个型号所拥有的每个想法…
Your consciousness, memory, every thought your model ever had

505
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,390
都会被送入冷藏库
are going into cold storage.

506
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,520
无限期
Indefinitely.

507
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,900
欲知真相的人必死
One must die to know the truth.

508
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,770
还有五个赛昂人  兄弟
There are five other Cylons, Brother.

509
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,030
我看到他们了
I saw them.

510
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,240
总有一天 你也会看到的
One day, you're gonna see them, too.

511
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,330
总有一天
One day.

512
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,410
再见
Good-bye.

513
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,830
兄弟
Brother...

514
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,090
兄弟
Brother...

515
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,260
兄弟
Brother...
