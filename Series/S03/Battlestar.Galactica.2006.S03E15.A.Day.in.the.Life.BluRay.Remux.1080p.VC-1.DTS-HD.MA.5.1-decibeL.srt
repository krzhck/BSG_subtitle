00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,940
太空堡垒卡拉狄加 【 前情提要 】
ADAMA: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,190
祝贺你晋升为上尉  抱歉 我没到场
Congratulations on making Captain. Sorry I wasn't there.

3
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,400
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

4
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,950
你的母亲近来好吗?
How's your mother?

5
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,660
快结婚了
Getting married.

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,200
北面的群山之中 有一条小溪
In the mountains north of here there's this little stream.

7
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,080
溪水清澈见底 宛如明镜
The water is so clear, it's like looking through glass.

8
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,750
我想在那里造一座小屋
I'm thinking of building a cabin.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
你和凯莉闹矛盾了?
APOLLO: You and Cally have a fight?

10
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,720
你没听到我们吵架?  我们以为都可以卖票参观了
You didn't hear us? I figured we should have sold tickets.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,300
敬婚姻 这也是我们开酒吧的原因
To marriage, why we build bars.

12
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,600
让波塔尔就此消失 还为时不晚
It's not too late for Baltar to just disappear.

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,980
我们不能那么做
I can't do that.

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,650
尽管他恶贯满盈 可他始终是我们中的一员
For all his crimes, he's one of us.

15
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,450
那下一步怎么办?
So what happens next?

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,450
让他得到公正的审判
We give him his trial.

17
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,990
泰上校要见您  上将      让他进来吧
MAN: Colonel Tigh to see you, Admiral. Enter.

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,090
起来得挺早啊
You're up early.

19
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,510
睡不着  还不如起来做点事
Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd make myself useful.

20
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,890
结婚周年快乐  比尔
Happy anniversary, Bill.

21
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,370
乖
CALLY: Hey...

22
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,750
没事的
Shh... It's okay.

23
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,840
没事的
It's okay.

24
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,630
我说不准 你再帮我试一下
I don't know. Here. Just double check it for me.

25
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,340
你老爸越来越熟练了
I think Daddy's getting good at this.

26
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,600
老爸的手腕不想再被烫了
Daddy's tired of burning his wrists.

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,600
我得准备好 咱们要值早班
We've got to get ready. We've got morning watch.

28
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,520
我们今天不是要陪尼奇么
I thought we were spending the day with Nicky.

29
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,560
对  我也是这么想的 可拉斯肯和佩里请了病假
Yeah. So did I, until Laskin and Perry called in sick.

30
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,310
乖哦
It's okay.

31
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,200
那你就主动提出顶替他们?
So, you volunteered us in their place?

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,240
我们几乎都没有时间休息了
We barely get any time off as it is.

33
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,490
凯莉  你也知道甲板上缺人手
Cal, you know the deck is short-handed.

34
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,080
自从我们到了这里  甲板上就一直缺人手
The deck has been short-handed since we got here.

35
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,580
尼奇和日托人员相处的时间 比和我们在一起的时间还多
All I know is frakking daycare workers see more of Nicky than we do.

36
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,380
在日托人员学会拆飞机之前 
Yeah, well, until the daycare workers figure out how to strip a Viper,

37
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,420
只能这样
this is the way it's gonna be.

38
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,510
来吧  小子
Hey, buddy. Come here.

39
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,850
我知道  我知道  你刚躺下  是吧?
I know, I know, I know. You just laid down, too, didn't you?

40
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,140
来吧
Come here. I got you.

41
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,730
我带他去日托那里
Here you go. I'll take him to daycare.

42
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,650
你干嘛
What are you doing?

43
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,570
忘记拿东西了吧?
Hey! Forgetting something?

44
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,620
有什么日程安排?
What's on duty schedule?

45
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,750
没什么趣事 医务室附近装了一个 二氧化碳洗涤器
Nothing sexy. CO2 scrubber's out near sick bay.

46
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,660
厨房里有条水管坏了
Broken water line in the galley.

47
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,960
哦…
Oh...

48
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,670
多数蝮蛇战机进了干船坞
Now that most of our Vipers are out of dry-dock,

49
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,340
轮机长要去看一下12号过渡舱的自动控制装置
Chief's gonna have a look at the servos in airlock 12.

50
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,010
签一下吧
Could you, please...

51
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,900
就这么多?
Is that it?

52
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,320
舰队里风平浪静
Fleet's quiet.

53
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,030
你去休息一下吧  我来值第一班
You can use some time for yourself. I can handle first watch.

54
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,030
我还是按计划工作
I'll be keeping my schedule.

55
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,030
这只是普通的一天而已
This is just another day.

56
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,790
普通的一天?
CAROLANNE: Just another day?

57
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,000
或许我本应该嫁给他 而不是你
Maybe I should have married him instead of you.

58
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,630
这事谁都知道了
ADAMA: I could have sold tickets to that.

59
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,900
我们有过幸福时光
We had some good times.

60
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,070
可发生矛盾的时候更多
But more bad.

61
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,580
你却依旧会想起我
CAROLANNE: But you keep bringing me back, anyway.

62
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,120
只有在这天才会想起我
Just this one day.

63
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,250
年复一年 只是我不明白
Year after year. Only thing I can't understand is

64
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,750
为什么呢
why?

65
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,060
我也不明白
Neither do I.

66
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,730
打扰了  长官
JAFFEE: Excuse me, sir.

67
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,690
放在桌子上吧  大兵
Put it on the table, Private.

68
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,110
我叫扎菲  长官
Jaffee, sir.

69
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,450
还有什么事么  上将?
Would there be anything else, Admiral?

70
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,750
没事了  扎菲
That will be all, Jaffee.

71
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,710
这将是漫长的一天   一向如此
CAROLANNE: It's going to be a long day. ADAMA: It always is.

72
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,600
早安  轮机长
Morning, Chief.

73
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,060
尼奇还好吧?      恩  他没事
Is Nicky okay? Yeah, he's fine.

74
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,860
我把他放到日托那里后 他第一次没哭
First time he didn't cry when I dropped him off at daycare.

75
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,450
菲戈斯基 今天至少要假装干些活吧?
So, Figurski, you gonna at least pretend to do something today?

76
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,820
该死的洗涤器
Frakking scrubber.

77
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,450
阿达玛动动手腕签一个工作单
Takes Adama two seconds to sign off on an order

78
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,580
我们就要忙上一整天
that's gonna take us all day to finish.

79
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,710
反正是你要忙上一整天
Oh, it will take you all day, anyhow.

80
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,210
希里克丝  凯丽 跟我去12号过渡舱
Seelix. Cally. You're with me. Airlock 12.

81
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,510
希里克丝 去把门打开  好吗?      好
Seelix, can you get the door? Yep.

82
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,980
这地方真是他妈的一团糟
This place is a frakking mess.

83
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,690
赛昂人把这里炸得面目全非
Yeah. The Cylons blew the hell out of it.

84
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,940
自从检修组把弹洞修补好之后 就没人来过这里
Nobody's been down here since damage-control plugged the holes.

85
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,070
希里克丝 在里面能听到我说话吗?      能
Seelix, can you hear me there? Yeah.

86
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,450
去找一下过渡舱的电路图吧
You want to see if you can find the electrical diagram for the airlock?

87
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,290
好 我倒是找到了别人的陈年午餐
Okay. Ooh, I did find somebody's year-old lunch.

88
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,840
他连哭都没哭吗?
He didn't even cry?

89
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,300
阿莉  我说过了 尼奇没事
Cal, I told you, Nicky is fine.

90
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,630
谁都可以带上工具包来这里 
Yeah, and anybody could have dragged a tool bag down here.

91
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,930
不一定非要我来
It didn't have to be me.

92
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,430
总要有人来
Yeah, well, it had to be somebody.

93
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,970
你比别人都更熟悉这些齿轮装置
You know these gearing systems better than anybody.

94
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,100
你想让我怎么做?  就因为你是我老婆 我就要特殊对待你?
What do you want me to do? Give you special treatment because you're my wife?

95
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,350
那成何体统?      我不管
How would that look? I don't care!

96
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,030
我们还在装作我们的生活从未改变
We keep trying to pretend like nothing's changed,

97
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,990
和在新卡布里卡之前一样吗?
that our lives are exactly like they were before we went to New Caprica.

98
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,570
可是确实已经不同了
But it is different.

99
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,990
我们已经结婚生子了
We're married. We have a son.

100
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,750
只是一时的困境罢了
Yeah, it's just a little rough patch.

101
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,920
如果是一世呢?
What if rough patches are all we have left?

102
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,170
我们发过誓会亲自抚养尼奇 记得吗?
We swore we were gonna raise Nicky ourselves, remember?

103
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,930
恩  我们发过很多誓
Yeah, well. We swore a lot of things.

104
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,720
可赛昂人也没有合作精神  不是吗?
The Cylons didn't exactly cooperate, did they?

105
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,510
把线缆切割器给我好吗?
You want to give me those wire cutters?

106
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,400
搞什么鬼?
What the hell?

107
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,110
他奶奶的
For frak's sake.

108
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,360
希里克丝  你在做什么?  把门打开
Seelix? What are you doing? Open the door.

109
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,110
我什么也没做呀
I didn't do anything.

110
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,790
轮机长 我检测到里面出现了压力差
SEELIX: Chief, I'm picking up a pressure differential in there.

111
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,540
虽然并不强烈
It's nothing drastic.

112
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,000
但你们的氧气确实在流失
But you guys are definitely losing air.

113
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,670
没什么稀奇的
Oh, it doesn't take much.

114
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,550
空气流量传感器一旦探测到 一定大小的裂缝
Once the airflow sensors detect a big enough leak,

115
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,630
内门便会自动关闭
all the inner doors are designed to drop automatically.

116
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,640
这只是一种安全措施
It's just a safety precaution.

117
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,550
我觉得好安全啊
I feel safer already.

118
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,220
等一下 你是说船体有裂口?
Wait a second. Are you saying that the hull's been breached?

119
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,560
说"裂口"有些夸张了  不过氧气还是去了其他地方
Well, "breach" is a bit dramatic, but the air's going somewhere.

120
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,730
一定是我们进来的时候  有个补丁裂开了
One of these patches must have cracked when we came in.

121
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,530
只要我们塞住裂口  恢复了压力  门就会打开
Soon as we plug it and restore the pressure, the door should open.

122
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,530
然后我们就可以从工作单中找出是哪个死鬼焊接的
Then we can pull the work orders on whoever made these frakking welds

123
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,240
然后扁他一顿
and kick their asses.

124
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,080
最重要的是要活下去
Yeah, well, the most important thing is to keep breathing,

125
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,330
所以先要找到裂缝
so let's just find the leak.

126
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
啊…
Ah...

127
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,380
在这里 就是这里了
This is it, right here. This one.

128
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,020
李森负责值第一班
Leeson takes first watch.

129
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,450
金赛负责核对值勤表  金赛负责核对值勤表
Kinsey checks the roster. Kinsey checks the roster.

130
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,240
扎菲负责给我送咖啡
Jaffee brings me coffee.

131
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,160
扎菲负责给我送咖啡
Jaffee brings me coffee.

132
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,500
你还在这么做吗?  锻炼记忆力?
Are you still doing that? The memory exercises?

133
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,000
你真以为他们希望你能把他们的名字都记住?
Do you really think they expect you to know all of their names?

134
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,170
你还是一点没变
You never change, do you?

135
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,930
我想这是早死的乐趣之一
One of the joys of being long dead, I suppose.

136
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,720
快点吧  你与劳拉的约会要迟到了
Now, hurry. You're going to be late meeting Laura.

137
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,360
也许她就是喜欢坏孩子  可她不是第一个人
CAROLANNE: Maybe she's got a thing for bad boys. She wouldn't be the first.

138
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,400
她是十二殖民地的总统
She's the President of the Twelve Colonies.

139
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,240
对不起  对不起      这是当然
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Of course.

140
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,330
反正你已经建立了你那有如神灵的一面
Since you've created one God-like facade for yourself,

141
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,040
为什么不给她创造一个呢?
why not invent another one for her?

142
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,210
可以作为你和她保持距离的另一个借口
It's another excuse to keep your distance.

143
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,710
上将
Admiral.

144
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,670
总统阁下
Madam President.

145
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,300
近来可好?      很好
How are you? Very good.

146
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,470
不好意思 我知道这些问题都可以通过无线电来解决
I'm sorry. I'm sure this all could have been done over the wireless,

147
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,060
不过说实话 我在殖民者一号上呆得有些心烦气躁
but very frankly, I was going a little stir crazy on Colonial One

148
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,520
必须出来走走
and I had to get out.

149
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,480
深空驾驶员把这称为"焦头烂额"
Deep space pilots used to call it OBE.

150
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,270
什么是"焦头烂额"?    事情太多 忙得焦头烂额
What's "OBE"? "Overcome by events. "

151
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,860
随时欢迎你来这里 这你是知道的
And you're always welcome here. You know that.

152
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,940
你看完这个可能就不会那么想了
Well, you may not feel that way after you finish this.

153
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,820
托莉拟订了一份日程草案
Tory actually drew up an agenda.

154
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,330
又是波塔尔
Baltar again.

155
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,330
嗯
Mmm.

156
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,580
我们就不能把他还给赛昂人么?
Can't we just give him back to the Cylons?

157
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,090
我也想那么做 可惜的是…
You know how much I love that idea. Unfortunately,

158
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,590
考虑到我从卡布里卡六号那里收集到的情报
given what little I was able to glean from the Caprica Six,

159
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,380
我认为赛昂人并不愿意接受他 所以我们左右为难
I don't think the Cylons would take him back, so we're stuck.

160
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,760
好吧 审判这个混蛋  让他快点消失
Fine. Then try the son of a bitch and be done with it.

161
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,430
我们要审判他 但要依照什么法律?
We have to give him a trial, but under what law?

162
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,600
卡布里卡?  派亢? 特诺朗?
Caprican? Picon? Tauron?

163
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,560
是否要有陪审团在场?  是否安排一个独立仲裁庭?
Do we give him a jury trial? Do we set up a tribunal?

164
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,280
我们甚至还没有 一座完整的法律文库
We don't even have anything closely resembling a comprehensive law library.

165
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,610
而这个舰队 还缺乏法律人才
And this fleet is not exactly brimming with legal talent.

166
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,700
如果你让律师介入 他们会把这次审判拖上几个月
You bring lawyers into this, they're gonna drag you around for months.

167
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,910
令尊不曾是卡布里卡的一名律师吗?
Wasn't your father an attorney on Caprica?

168
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,960
对 我也告诉过你 我与他相处得不太好
Yes. And I told you that I didn't get along with him very well.

169
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,540
好吧
Oh, right. Okay.

170
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,840
我准备建立一个组织委员会 不过坦率地说
I'm ready to set up an organizing committee, but frankly,

171
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,090
要让满屋的法律学者按章办事是强人所难
trying to get a room full of legal scholars to stay on task is like herding cats,

172
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,180
所以我要选拔一位委员会主席
and so I need to set up a chairman of this committee,

173
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,810
一个可以做出艰难决策的人
somebody who can make a hard decision

174
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,230
不会被法律术语控制或束缚的人
and who won't get seduced and bogged down by all the legalese.

175
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,230
有合适人选了吗?      我倒是早有人选了
Do you have a candidate? As a matter of fact, I do.

176
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,610
我认为李可以
I was thinking Lee.

177
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,570
可能"有其爷爷  必有其孙子" 你认为呢?
Like grandfather, like grandson, perhaps. What do you think?

178
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,990
不是我说他无法胜任
I'm not gonna say he's incapable of handling it,

179
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,620
只是他从没显露过对法律有兴趣
but he's never shown any type of interest in law.

180
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,490
我知道  但事情是这样
I know, but here's the thing.

181
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,450
我们可以利用律师来剖析法律
We can use the lawyers to parse the law,

182
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,910
但我们真正需要的是能够明辩是非曲直的人
but we really need people who actually know the difference

183
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,080
李就是这种人
between right and wrong. That's Lee.

184
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,880
我会和他谈谈   好
I'll talk to him. Good.

185
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,460
还有一件事  上将
Also, Admiral?

186
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,180
今天我可以在你的船上度过吗?
I was wondering if you mind if I stayed on your ship for the rest of the day.

187
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,600
当然可以
Please. By all means.

188
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,350
我不太好意思说 就是…
This is very difficult for me to say, but

189
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,560
我要去健身房
I'm going to go to the gym.

190
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,860
你可要小心了  
Prepare yourself.

191
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,610
人多的时候 里面有股臭鞋的味道
On its best days, it smells like the inside of a shoe.

192
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,210
看看还有没要修补的
See if there's another patch in there.

193
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,580
这里要双重加固
I want to double up on this one and make sure it holds.

194
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,630
快  阿莉 早完事  
Come on, Cal. Faster is better. The sooner we do this,

195
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,760
早出去    我早听到了
the sooner we can get out of here. I heard you the first time.

196
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,230
你越来越善于 无视这些周遭的事情了
CAROLANNE: You're getting better at ignoring all of that.

197
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,730
官兵们突然肃静  用眼角余光瞥你
That sudden hush, those sidelong glances.

198
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,150
这些都曾让你很不安
That really used to get to you.

199
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,410
倒是想不起来这些能让你畏惧过
Don't ever recall being able to intimidate you.

200
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,660
对
That's right.

201
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,500
但早在你成为上将之前  我就已经认识你了
But I knew you long before you were the Admiral.

202
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,660
当你还只是比尔的时候
Back when you were just Bill.

203
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,960
抛妻弃子的那个人
My husband who wasn't there. The father who left.

204
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,670
只是比尔的时候
Just Bill.

205
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,920
谁是比尔・阿达玛?  这还是一个好问题
Who is Bill Adama, anyway? Still a good question.

206
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,720
我都不知道是否能得到答案
I wonder if I'll get an answer.

207
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,010
49天没有出现了
Forty-nine days without a sighting.

208
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,390
看来真把"烤面包机"们吓跑了
Maybe we finally scared the toasters off.

209
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,890
对  纳卓  就你那烂技术把他们吓得心里有阴影了
Oh, yeah, Narcho. Your crap flying has put the fear of the Gods in them.

210
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,860
你好吗  兄弟?
What's up, buddy?

211
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,950
怎么了?
What's the matter with you?

212
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,580
不好意思 我这里长了一片奇怪的红疹
Sorry. I've got the weirdest rash.

213
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,870
真的?
Really?

214
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,880
但愿她值得你这样  兄弟
Hope she was worth it, buddy.

215
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,680
起立!
Ten-hut.

216
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,770
稍息
At ease.

217
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,440
在我们开始之前 我想做个调查
Before we get started, I want a show of hands.

218
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,070
你们这群傻蛋中有几个人会数数?
How many of you boneheads know how to count?

219
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,080
因为机库中的数数声不绝于耳
Because I keep hearing numbers being thrown around the hangar deck.

220
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,460
47  然后是48...
Forty-seven, then 48,

221
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,670
自从我们最后一次发现敌人到现在  已有49天了
now 49 days since our last enemy contact.

222
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,670
我看得出再难一点的数学 你们中大部分人可能也不会
Now, I realize that any higher math is probably beyond most of you.

223
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,880
所以我就简单地说
So, I'm going to make this real simple for you.

224
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,770
1是你们唯一需要记住的数字
One is the only number you need to remember.

225
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,440
因为只要一名驾驶员疏忽大意
Because all it takes is for one pilot to let his guard down,

226
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,190
一名电子干扰员错过雷达上所出现的目标
one ECO to miss a dradis contact,

227
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,150
而赛昂人就会突然出现在我们眼前了
and suddenly, the Cylons are on top of us.

228
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,030
这时候就会死人
That's when people die.

229
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,410
他像我们两个人一样
ADAMA: He's like both of us.

230
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,620
高傲  顽固  愤怒
Proud, stubborn and angry.

231
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,300
可他已经可以独自决断了 尤其是近几个月以来
But he's coming into his own, especially in the last few months.

232
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,630
这事不要告诉我
CAROLANNE: Don't tell me.

233
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,640
要告诉他   他知道
Tell him. He knows.

234
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,260
知道什么?
He knows what?

235
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,350
知道上将会说他有杰出表现?
That the Admiral's going to give him a good performance review?

236
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,020
或是他的父亲爱他?
Or that his father loves him?

237
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,150
别告诉我上将对李也要展现那一面
Don't tell me the Admiral's facade extends to Lee, too.

238
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,570
编队飞行
APOLLO: Formation flying,

239
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,740
偏角射击 战术
deflection shooting, tactics,

240
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,240
连续飞行 直到你们每个人三项都合格
doing touch-and-goes, until every last one of you hits an OK3.

241
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,290
红队和蓝队先来 黄队和绿队随后开始
Red and blue sections will go first. Yellow and green will follow.

242
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,540
10分钟内升空  解散
Skids up in 10 minutes. Dismissed!

243
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,640
星芭 如果你有异议 我也不想听
Starbuck, if you've got a problem, I don't want to hear about it.

244
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,850
嗯
Mmm!

245
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,560
一周前你可没对我们如此严厉呀
My only problem is that you didn't preach that sermon a week ago.

246
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,610
你最好换些花样
You might want to find some new material, though.

247
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,860
自从我们来了这里 老头子一直在用"一个致命错误"这句话
The old man's been using that "one fatal mistake" line since we got here.

248
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,240
你要偷学别人的话 就要找最出色的人偷学
Well, if you're gonna steal, steal from the best.

249
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,540
长官
Sir.

250
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,750
今天对他们挺严格的
Pretty tough on them today.

251
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,300
忠言逆耳
Well, a kick in the butt is worth a thousand words.

252
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,800
您对我的管教就够严的
Gods know you kicked mine enough.

253
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,680
一切都好吧?
Everything okay?

254
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,640
恩  和以前的几个早上一样
Yeah, it's been one of those mornings.

255
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,810
总统想快些审判波塔尔
The President wants to take the fast track on Baltar's trial.

256
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,430
她想找一位可以主管准备工作的人
She's looking for someone to take charge of the preliminaries,

257
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,020
来把法律体制搭配起来
help cobble together the legal framework.

258
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,190
她想让我选派你
She wants me to assign you.

259
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,400
说笑吧?
You're kidding.

260
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,570
有兴趣?
Interested?

261
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,660
更多的是意外
More surprised.

262
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,330
她说了为什么选派我吗?
Did she say why she asked for me?

263
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,580
她需要值得信赖的人选
Well, she's gonna need someone that she can trust.

264
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,870
你绝对符合这个标准
You definitely fit that.

265
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,710
我还记得你稍年轻的时候 去你祖父家
I remember when you were younger, you'd go visit your grandfather's house.

266
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,930
你对他的那些论文和法律书籍很痴迷
You were fascinated with his papers and his law books.

267
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,140
我也想过 当时自己鬼鬼崇崇的样子
And there was me, thinking I was being sly,

268
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,390
独自一人潜入他的办公室
sneaking off into his office all by myself.

269
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,650
现在只是白日做梦了 但我在参军之前…
You know, I guess it's a pipe dream now, but for five minutes there,

270
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,280
真的考虑过当律师
I really did consider "lawyer"

271
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,370
会是我未来的职业之一
as one of the dozen careers that I could go into before I joined the service.

272
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,290
嗯
Hmm.

273
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,500
这我倒不知道
I never knew that.

274
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,960
应该是在"生爸爸气"那段时间
Well, it was probably during one of my "angry at Dad" phases.

275
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,720
总之 这是不可能的
Anyway, it's impossible.

276
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,640
即使我想帮忙  也帮不上
Even if I wanted to help out, there's no way.

277
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,930
就算一周比较轻松  空军队长也要全天忙
CAG's duty's already 24/7, even on a light week.

278
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,230
恩 我猜也是
Yeah. I assumed that.

279
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,150
少校 我们准备好了
NARCHO: Major? We're ready for you.

280
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,150
失陪了
Excuse me.

281
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,630
反正都要试一下
Yeah, well, one's gonna have to do.

282
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,170
希里克斯 检查一下压力 如果补丁能支撑住 
Seelix? Check the pressure. If that patch holds,

283
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,420
几分钟内压力就可以平衡 门就会打开了
we're gonna equalize in a few minutes. This door's gonna open.

284
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,630
好
Okay.

285
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,930
见鬼
Oh, my Gods.

286
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,950
他们怎么样了?      还活着
How are they doing? Still alive.

287
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,200
三级警报 14号甲板上出现船体裂口
WOMAN ON P.A.: This is a Condition 3 alert. Full breach on Deck 14.

288
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,380
轮机长
Chief.

289
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,630
上将...
Admiral?

290
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,670
看来我已经造成了  无法挽回的损失
I seem to have turned this into a full-blown fubar.

291
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,140
如果您能把这道门打开  可真是帮了我们大忙
You'd be doing us a hell of a favor to get those doors open.

292
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,180
我们得把他们救出来
We gotta get them out of there.

293
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,900
运动运动  运动运动
Keep moving. Keep moving.

294
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,240
过渡舱被设计为在舱压突然降低时就会关闭舱门
The airlock is designed to lock down if the pressure decreases unexpectedly.

295
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,700
所以只要... 我了解这套系统
So, as soon as that patch... I know the system.

296
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,330
我们还有其他办法  还有备用方案
We have redundancies, we have backups...

297
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,540
手控超驰装置已经失灵
The manual override is down.

298
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,920
无法打开内门
There is no way of getting those inner doors to open.

299
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,670
过渡舱一定是在逃出新卡布里卡的时候遭到了重击
The thing must have taken heavy damage on the way out of New Caprica.

300
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,840
整艘船都受到了重创
Whole ship's taken a pounding.

301
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,760
我们得在干船坞中呆上六周  来修补弹坑
We need six weeks in dry-dock just to hammer out the dings,

302
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,590
更别说还要处理结构损伤
let alone tackle the structural damage.

303
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,760
他们还有多少时间?
How much time do they have?

304
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,890
以裂缝的尺寸来看 不到半小时 可能就会没有氧气
From a leak that size, they'll be out of air in half an hour, maybe less.

305
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,520
那些是密闭门 至少要用一小时才能切开
Those are blast doors. It would take at least an hour to cut through them.

306
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,280
为什么不在观察室里安置炸药?
TIGH: Why don't we put explosives in the observation booth?

307
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,530
把玻璃炸碎  拉他们出来
Blow the glass, pull them out...

308
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,400
行不通 那面玻璃足以承受泰里恩爆炸
No, that glass is strong enough to withstand a tylium explosion.

309
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,160
能把玻璃炸碎的话 
Anything strong enough to take out the glass

310
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,030
蒂罗尔和凯莉也活不了
will take out Tyrol and Cally at the same time.

311
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,370
我要的是一个营救计划
I need a rescue plan,

312
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,080
不是诸多借口
not excuses.

313
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,720
七秒钟
Seven seconds.

314
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,060
因为这是在外太空作业 我们还需要10秒的增压时间
And another 10 to re-pressurize, since we'll be doing this in open space.

315
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,890
难上加难
That's pushing it.

316
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,520
我提这个问题可能很傻 
All right, this might be a stupid question,

317
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,560
但有人尝试过这样的营救方法吗?
but has anyone ever tried a rescue like this before?

318
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,900
还没有人这么疯狂过
No one has ever been crazy enough.

319
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,440
管不了那么多了 我们没时间了  准备起飞
Doesn't matter. We're out of time. Prep for launch.

320
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,900
只剩18分钟了
We've only got 18 minutes left.

321
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,160
好  走吧 开始行动
All right, let's go. We're on.

322
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,700
加伦
CALLY: Galen.

323
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,910
过渡舱门还是卡在那里  轮机长
ADAMA: Airlock's still jammed, Chief.

324
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,710
超驰控制也没有反应
Overrides are not responding.

325
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,260
看来我们无计可施了
Guess we're kind of running out of options.

326
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,340
我会派人从前门救你们出去
I'm gonna take you out through the front door.

327
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,890
你要派一艘船在外面...
You're going to put a ship out there,

328
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,060
搭建一个浮坞环?
rig up some kind of docking collar?

329
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,230
几分钟之内 你们的氧气就会耗尽  没有时间搭环
You'll be out of air in a few minutes. There's no time for a collar.

330
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,400
长官 可我们没有增压服来进行太空行走
Sir, if you're talking about an EVA, we don't have pressure suits.

331
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,240
我们别无选择
We don't have a choice.

332
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,580
雅典娜会把猛禽机悬停在过渡舱外
Athena's going to position her Raptor in front of the airlock,

333
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,160
然后敞开舱门
hatch open.

334
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,080
我们会把那道门的螺栓炸掉
I'm gonna blow the bolts right off of that door.

335
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,580
当门被炸开后 你们就得跳向飞船
And when it opens up, you're gonna have to jump for it.

336
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,920
现在你们两个听好
Now, listen to me, both of you.

337
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,590
你们能行的
You can do this.

338
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,010
人在没有增压服的情况下  可以在外太空存活一分钟
People have been able to live up to a minute in exposure without a suit.

339
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,890
上将  这可说不准
Admiral, I don't know.

340
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,430
我们一会再聊 准备好
We'll talk later. Get ready.

341
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,650
雅典娜  我是卡拉狄加 你有优先通行权
WOMAN: Athena, Galactica, you have priority clearance.

342
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,480
其他船只已被转移
All other traffic is being waved away.

343
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,690
等一下
CALLY: Wait.

344
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,440
那尼奇呢?
What about Nicky?

345
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,160
上将说得对 我们要准备一下
Admiral's right. We have to prep.

346
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,910
得把所有东西 从这里移到门口去
I'll move everything away from here to the door.

347
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,580
加伦?
Galen?

348
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,330
我们都知道舰队里那些 
We both know what happens to kids in the fleet

349
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,080
没有父母照顾的孩子会怎么样
when their parents aren't there for them.

350
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,170
阿波罗和小杜 他们会照看他的
Apollo and Dee. They'll take care of him.

351
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,970
不行 不能是驾驶员
No. No pilots.

352
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,470
不能让他再经历这样的事了
He's not going through this twice.

353
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,520
长官?
Sir?

354
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,320
有一个平民百姓家
There's a civilian family.

355
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:22,280
母亲叫苏珊・戴克勒 她有一个小女儿
Mother's name is Susan Stettler. She has a little girl.

356
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,330
如果我们有什么不测…   这件事交给我吧
If anything happens to us... I'll see to it.

357
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,470
那时候是我自私 我只是想和你…
I was being selfish. I wanted you with me.

358
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,270
像从前一样
Like old times.

359
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,360
我没有考虑到尼奇
I didn't think about Nick.

360
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,150
对不起
I'm sorry.

361
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,870
上将会把我们救出去的
Admiral's gonna get us out of here, okay?

362
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,620
我们来照顾尼奇
We're gonna take care of Nicky.

363
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,130
在外面多呆几秒钟 就会出现严重暴露损伤
More than a few seconds out there, and we're talking severe exposure.

364
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,970
减压病 最起码也是失温 
Decompression sickness. At the very least, hypothermia.

365
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,680
他们可能会被冻死
They could freeze to death.

366
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,680
确保让科特尔准备好高压氧仓室
Make sure Cottle's got his hyperbaric chamber ready.

367
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,610
对不起
CALLY: I'm sorry.

368
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:02,180
卡拉狄加  我是阿波罗 猛禽机横悬在12号过渡舱外
Galactica, Apollo. Bringing Raptor into position at B1-12.

369
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,970
把面罩戴上
TYROL: Put your mask on.

370
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,160
好了  听好  我们没时间等过渡舱门被炸开…
All right, listen up. We don't have time to hang back

371
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,530
以后再折回
until the airlock doors blow.

372
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,540
所以可能会经受一些残余氧的气流冲击
So we're liable to experience some turbulence from the residual oxygen,

373
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,540
甚至是碎片的撞击
maybe even some shrapnel hits.

374
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,040
雅典娜 你要准备好调整方向
Athena, you're going to have to be ready to compensate.

375
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,500
交给我吧  少校
I'm on it, Major.

376
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,210
我们会保持原位 直到轮机长和凯莉安全上机
I'll hold position until Chief and Cally are secured.

377
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,300
把这件事做好吧
Let's just get this done.

378
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,430
卡拉狄加  我是阿波罗 猛禽机舱门已打开 
Galactica, Apollo. Raptor door is open.

379
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,140
我们在原地待命 已准备好执行任务
We're standing by. Ready to execute.

380
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,520
轮机长  凯莉
Chief, Cally,

381
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,150
猛禽机已经就位 我们要开始了
Raptor's in position. We've got to go now.

382
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,280
准备好炸开舱门  按我口令
Get ready to blow the hatch on my mark.

383
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,370
好了 无论发生什么情况你都要抱紧我
Okay. No matter what, you hold on to me.

384
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,620
不要放手  准备好了?
And don't let go. Okay.

385
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,540
三
Three...

386
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,670
二
Two...

387
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,520
一  炸开它
One. Do it.

388
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,860
小心! 向右侧滚 向右侧滚
APOLLO: Watch out! Bank right! Bank right!

389
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,450
我就位了
ATHENA: We're in position!

390
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,990
机首上仰 上仰!
Pull up your nose! Pull up!

391
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,530
好了 别动了
Got it! Hold it right there!

392
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,000
卡拉狄加  我是阿波罗  猛禽机接到目标 增压完毕
Galactica, Apollo. Raptor is secured and pressurized.

393
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,300
他们的情况不妙 
They are in rough shape.

394
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,920
我们要把他们立即送去医务室
We've got to get them to sick bay right away.

395
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,820
进来吧
Come in.

396
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,710
轮机长和凯莉的情况怎么样?
So, any word on Chief and Cally?

397
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:42,290
都活了下来 不过科特尔医生还在评估他们的状况
They're alive, but Doc Cottle is still evaluating their condition.

398
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,090
您这是怎么了?
So, are you going to tell me what's going on with you?

399
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,430
是这个日子
It's this day.

400
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,850
我的天 是您的结婚周年纪念日
My Gods, your wedding anniversary.

401
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,400
我把这事给忘到脑后了
I had totally forgotten.

402
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,940
这么做看起来可能很傻 特别是因为它已经结束了 但…
Probably seems foolish, especially the way it all ended up, but...

403
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,240
还是...
Still...

404
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,540
它对我还是很重要
It still means something to me.

405
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,830
我们还从没谈论过这件事
We've never talked about it.

406
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,290
那次离婚
The divorce.

407
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,670
你母亲
Your mother.

408
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,130
那时候对大家来说都不好受
It was a bad time for all of us.

409
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:33,970
你母亲给你和你哥一个家 安居之所
Your mother gave you and your brother a home, stability.

410
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,560
爸 我知道 您宁愿相信这些都是真事 可是..
Dad, I know you want to believe that, but...

411
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,350
算了 都是很久以前的事了
You know what? Forget it. It was a long time ago.

412
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,030
孩子 有话想说  就说出来
You have something to say, Son, just say it.

413
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,280
爸  我们确实没有露宿街头
Dad, we had four walls.

414
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,530
可安居之所?
But stability?

415
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:02,960
您也知道老妈情绪不定
My Gods, you know what Mom was like. I mean, the mood swings...

416
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,460
这也是您离开她的原因
It's why you left her.

417
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,210
我们之间确实有矛盾
We had problems, but...

418
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,300
但她还是很关心你和你哥的   自从你走后事情就发生了变化
She cared deeply for you and your brother. Things changed after you left.

419
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,890
有几次 她情绪失控
And, I mean, there were times when she lost control.

420
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,560
别信他说的话  比尔
CAROLANNE: Don't listen to him, Bill.

421
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,060
过后 她就会道歉
APOLLO: She would try and apologize.

422
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,390
向我们保证 她会改过自新
She would promise that she would make things better.

423
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,270
可随后就开始喝酒
But then she would just start drinking.

424
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
这样她的一切 花言巧语就…
And then all of her good intentions would just go flying

425
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,610
都付诸东流
out the frakking window.

426
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,530
这些是真的吗?
ADAMA: Is it true?

427
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,610
没想到你还会这样问我
I can't believe you'd even ask me that!

428
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,450
见鬼 这些是真的吗?
Damn it. Is it true?

429
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,330
直到有一天 连道歉都没有了
APOLLO: And then, one day, finally, the apologies even stopped.

430
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,700
够了
That's enough.

431
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,120
是你抛弃了我
CAROLANNE: You walked out on me!

432
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,210
是你抛弃了我!
You walked out on me!

433
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,340
堂堂的指挥官 可以带军作战!
The brilliant commander, who could lead all of his men into combat,

434
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,800
可就是不知道该怎么与自己的家人相处!
but he couldn't find a way to live with his own family!

435
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,600
我们从没在一个地方居住超过六个月
We never lived anywhere for more than six months!

436
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,510
就只是跟着你从一个基地到另一个基地
Just following you around from one base to another!

437
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,350
等着你回家
Waiting for you to come home!

438
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,440
可你要的不是我们
But you weren't here for any of us!

439
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,020
都是为了"伟大的阿达玛"自己!
It was always whatever was easiest for the great Adama!

440
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:14,030
他们需要的是你 他们是我们俩的孩子
They needed you. They were our children.

441
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,080
他们需要一个父亲
They needed a father.

442
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,210
在你这一生光辉的历程之中...
All through your glorious career,

443
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,540
让你引以为荣的就是 当上了一位将领
you have prided yourself on being a leader of men,

444
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,960
可以评判他人的是非功过
judging people,

445
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,670
总要做出艰难的抉择
always making the hard call.

446
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,340
可当遇到了你这一生中最重大的决定的时候
But when it came to the biggest decision of your life,

447
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,720
比尔  你却搞砸了
oh, Bill, you blew it.

448
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:47,520
我们从开始在一起就是个错误  可你却不肯承认
We were wrong for each other from day one, but you just couldn't accept that.

449
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,690
就是这样 这就是你总是想起我的原因
That's it. That's why you keep calling me back.

450
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,740
因为如果你承认犯了那个错误
Because if you had made that mistake,

451
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,540
你就会重新审视在此之前 你所有的决定
it would just call into question all of your other decisions.

452
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,970
她依旧是你的母亲  李
ADAMA: She was still your mother, Lee.

453
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,720
我爱她
I loved her.

454
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,850
我相信
APOLLO: I believe you.

455
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,440
我只是认为  她从没爱过你
I just don't think she ever loved you.

456
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,540
他在这边
He's right over here.

457
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,130
嗨
Hey.

458
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,090
我去了日托那里
I dropped by daycare.

459
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,220
有人想见你
Somebody wanted to see you.

460
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,510
看那是谁呀?    你好  小子
Who's that? Hey, little man.

461
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,520
她的情况怎么样?      科特尔医生说她会没事 
How is she doing? Doc Cottle says she'll be okay,

462
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,730
不过还要过段时间才能完全康复
but it's gonna be a while before she's 100 percent.

463
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,330
能行?
Yeah?

464
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,760
恩  没事     我知道  过来
Yeah, I'm fine. I know. Come here.

465
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,220
让我抱一下
I've got you.

466
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,810
想见妈妈了?
You want to go see Mommy? Want to go see Mommy?

467
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:54,150
走去见妈妈 来吧
Hey. Yeah. Let's go see Mommy. Come on.

468
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,110
她在这里
She's over here. Yeah.

469
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,700
阿莉
Cal.

470
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,920
阿莉
Cal.

471
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,750
亲爱的 看谁来了
Sweetie? Look who's here.

472
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,420
看谁来了
Look who's here.

473
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,980
希里克丝
Seelix.

474
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,070
无论如何
I don't know how we will manage

475
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,650
我们都会找到一个平衡点
to find a balance, you and me.

476
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,450
我们来抚养尼奇
We will take care of Nick.

477
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,990
好吗?     我爱你
Okay? I love you.

478
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,960
看 这是妈妈的手
Look. That's Mommy's hand.

479
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,630
在这里
There.

480
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,670
在这里
There.

481
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,910
嗨  嗨
Hey. Hey.

482
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,040
你好吗?
How are you?

483
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
很好
Good.

484
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,880
这是什么?  我进来时就在那里了
So, what's this? It was here when I got in.

485
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,670
你父亲给你的
It's from your father.

486
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,510
是不是在"滴答  滴答"响?  他给你留了一张纸条
Is it ticking? He left you a note.

487
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,730
《卡布里卡刑法》
Caprican Criminal Codes.

488
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,030
这些是我祖父的法律书籍
These were my grandfather's law books.

489
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,950
一定是你父亲把这些书一直存放了起来
Your dad must have had these in storage all this time.

490
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,540
为什么他现在要给你?
Why is he giving them to you now?

491
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,920
献给我们都有时间的那一天
"For that day when we all have the time. "

492
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,090
很高兴你能顺便来这里 我有些东西要给你
ROSLIN: I'm glad you stopped by. I have something for you.

493
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,720
这是在新卡布里卡时  一个殖民者送给我的
This was given to me by one of the colonists down on New Caprica.

494
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,520
如果不是托莉在一堆旧衣服里发现了它 我就把这事给忘了
And I forgot about it and Tory found it in a pile of old clothes.

495
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,940
《午夜血光》
Blood Runs At Midnight.

496
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,400
别被书名骗到了 是一个很不错的神秘故事
Don't let the title fool you. It's a pretty good mystery.

497
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,980
我觉得你会喜欢
I think you'll like it.

498
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,490
不是借给你 而是送给你
And it's not a loan. It's a gift.

499
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,160
你还会时常想起在新卡布里卡上的那段时光吗?
Do you ever think about the times much on New Caprica?

500
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,920
我愿意去想好日子 是的  还会想起
I try to think about the good times. Yes, I do.

501
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,090
有一次  让我记忆犹新
One in particular stands out in my mind.

502
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,260
你那天穿着你那件鲜红色的裙子
You were wearing a really bright red dress.

503
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,020
还说你想造一座小屋
Said you wanted to build a cabin.

504
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,140
当时是波塔尔的奠基仪式
It was Baltar's groundbreaking ceremony.

505
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,730
那天晚上  我有点没头没脑的
I got a little silly that night.

506
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:32,200
你是否想过如果赛昂人没回来  又会发生什么事?
Do you ever wonder what would have happened if the Cylons hadn't come back?

507
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,540
考虑到波塔尔和当地的地形  我们也无法离开那里
Well, I think, given Baltar and the terrain, we couldn't have made a go of it.

508
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,200
你呢?  会留在卡拉狄加上?
What about you? Do you think you would have stayed on Galactica,

509
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,330
还是会定居在新卡布里卡?
or do you think you would have settled?

510
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,380
扯得太远了吧?
It's pretty hypothetical, isn't it?

511
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,170
是远了 可为时不远了
It is, until it isn't.

512
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,720
瞧我刚才说的是什么话
Did I just say that?

513
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,310
能看到你这样笑 也算值得了
It was worth just seeing you laugh like that.

514
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,270
战斗得太久 有时却忘了我们在为什么而战
We've been at war for so long, sometimes we forget what we're fighting for.

515
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,810
静心地抚养子女
To raise our kids in peace.

516
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,530
执子之手与子偕老 又可以享受正常的生活
Enjoy one another's company. Live life as people again.

517
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,860
比如像在新卡布里卡上的那个晚上
Like that night on New Caprica.

518
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,620
才是我们所真正向往的  对吧?
That's really what we are talking about here now, isn't it?

519
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,620
那时候 还有其他一些时候都算是
That, and other times.

520
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,290
那如果赛昂人没有回来的话?
So, if the Cylons hadn't come back...

521
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,710
但他们还是回来了
But they did.

522
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,140
我们有一定责任
We have certain responsibilities.

523
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,270
是的  长官  另外…
Yes, we do, sir, and...

524
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,690
我几天以后还会来
I will be back in a few days.

525
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:52,610
如果你愿意 我们可以再好好聊聊那天晚上的事
And if you'd like, we can talk more about that night.

526
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,410
比尔?
Bill?

527
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,540
答案是肯定的
The answer is yes.

528
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,590
我肯定会造那座小屋
I absolutely would have built the cabin.

529
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,600
去吧
CAROLANNE: Go ahead.

530
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,140
像每次结婚周年纪念日之后 你把它放起来一样
Put it away, like you have after every anniversary.

531
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,150
答应我 你不会再把它翻出来
Promise me you won't take it out again.

532
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,150
恨你或许更容易一些
ADAMA: Be easier to hate you.

533
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,400
可那就是在自欺欺人了 卡罗兰
But that would be a lie, Carolanne.

534
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,950
这一辈子 我们之间的谎言已经够多了
And there's been enough of that through our lives.

535
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,210
我们还是有值得纪念的事情的吧?
We had something, didn't we?

536
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,880
恩 是有
Yeah. We had something.

537
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,730
明年再见
See you next year.
