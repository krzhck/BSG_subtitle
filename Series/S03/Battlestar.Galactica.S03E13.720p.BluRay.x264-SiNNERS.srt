1
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,270
太空堡垒卡拉狄加 【前情提要】
BALTAR: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,190
不  对不起 我不能再这样了
Oh, no, I'm sorry. I can't live like this.

3
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,280
我不会离婚 你也不会对你妻子不忠
So, I won't divorce and you won't cheat.

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,360
这让我们处于何种境地?
So, where does that leave us?

5
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,450
进退两难
Trapped.

6
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,570
这是什么?
What's this?

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,370
这是一份对所有犯人的草率处决书
D'ANNA: This orders the summary executions

8
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,080
他们的名字都在下一页
of all the detainees listed on the next page.

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,450
需要你的签名
It requires your signature.

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,960
这是死刑执行书 你看过这份名单上的名字吗?
GAETA: This is a death warrant! Have you seen the names on this list?

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,210
你知道他们会怎么做吗?
Do you have any idea what they're about to do out there?

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,090
如果你确实是赛昂人 "终极五人"之一的话
NO. 6: If you really are a Cylon, a member of the Final Five,

13
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,840
这些感情也只是你的一段程序
these feelings are just part of your programming.

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,760
只有进入神庙的人  才能看到"终极五人"
The Final Five, revealed only to those who enter the Temple.

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,300
只有被神选中的人才能看到  被神选中的人才能看到
Only to the Chosen One... The Chosen One...

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,890
你们两人的宿命将分道扬镳 盖尤斯
NO. 6: Her destiny will part company from yours, Gaius.

17
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,180
她不是被神所选中的  而你是
She's not the Chosen One, you are.

18
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,230
神啊  在我死前告诉我真相
Dear God, tell me the truth before I die.

19
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,400
我是赛昂人吗?
Am I a Cylon?

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,940
欢迎回家  总统阁下
Welcome home, Mr. President.

21
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,850
闭上眼 安睡吧
BALTAR:Close your eyes, go to sleep

22
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,640
小宝贝在摇篮中数绵羊
Baby's in the cradle counting sheep

23
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,780
爬上你那座梦之屋
Climb up to your house of dreams

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,030
小宝贝在摇篮中快快睡
Baby's in the cradle fast asleep

25
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,330
我要在睡醒前死掉吗
Should I die before I wake...

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,710
不好意思 现编的
Sorry. Improvising.

27
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,760
你这么做是对的  盖尤斯
You're doing the right thing, Gaius.

28
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,980
盖尤斯?      什么?
Gaius? What?

29
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,070
对 对
Yes. Yes.

30
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,870
醒醒!
Wake up!

31
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,960
闭上眼 安睡吧
NO. 6 AND BALTAR:Close your eyes, go to sleep

32
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,970
小宝贝在摇篮中数绵羊
Baby's in the cradle counting sheep

33
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,930
爬上你那座梦之屋
Climb up to your house of dreams...

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
等等
Wait.

35
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,450
等一下
Wait a moment.

36
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,290
我需要些时间整理一下思绪
I need some time to think this through.

37
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,410
太迟了
Too late, Gaius.

38
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,470
是揭开谜底的时候了
It's time to learn the truth.

39
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,400
中士    抱歉  长官
Sergeant. Sorry, sir.

40
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,275
没有总统的直接授权 
No one's allowed to speak to the prisoner

41
00:03:56,276 --> 00:03:58,070
任何人不准与犯人交谈
 without direct Presidential authorization.

42
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,530
我已经得到了批准 需要立即去犯人谈话
I already have authorization. I need to speak to the prisoner, now.

43
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,900
退后  长官
Step back, sir.

44
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,120
就这样  盖尤斯
That's it, Gaius.

45
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,160
深呼吸
Deep breaths.

46
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
深呼吸
Deep breaths.

47
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,930
就这样  盖尤斯  深呼吸  深呼吸
That's it, Gaius. Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

48
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,390
第一次是最难受的 你表现得很不错
First time's the hardest. You're doing wonderfully.

49
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,980
我还活着?
I'm alive?

50
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,980
我还活着
I'm alive.

51
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,990
谢天谢地  我还活着
Thank God, I'm alive!

52
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,200
我不是总说要有信心么
I always told you to have faith.

53
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,120
就是说我没有背叛任何人
Then no one was betrayed.

54
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,210
我本就不是他们中的一员
I was never one of them.

55
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,550
我是你们的人
I am one of you.

56
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,840
你是这样认为的吗  盖尤斯?
Is that what you think, Gaius?

57
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,890
我就知道 我就知道
I knew it. I knew it.

58
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,730
我早就知道自己与众不同
I always knew I was different.

59
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,020
异于常人
Special.

60
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,820
也许还有少许天分
Maybe a little gifted. I was...

61
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,860
呃
Uh... Uh...

62
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,070
这可有点狠呐 挺疼的
That's a bit rough, actually.

63
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,490
怎么了?
What's wrong?

64
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,280
你错了  盖尤斯
You're wrong, Gaius.

65
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,080
你不是赛昂人 你是人类  你死定了
You're not Cylon. You're human. And you're dead!

66
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,550
他活过来了
He's alive.

67
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,100
我去叫科特尔
I'll get Cottle.

68
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,070
反正肯定会让你大吃一惊的
I'm just saying. You're gonna be surprised.

69
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,490
恩  少校     这边
Yeah, well, Major... Right this way.

70
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,620
老乔之家 我都没去过酒吧
Joe's? Well, I think I've seen a bar before.

71
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,470
真的假的啊?  来吧
You got to be frakking kidding me. Come on.

72
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,850
这边  老乔    蒂罗尔轮机长 欢迎你
Hey, this way. Hey, Joe. Chief Tyrol, welcome.

73
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,020
少校的朋友就是我的朋友
Any friend of the Major's is a friend of mine,

74
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,020
也就是说 给你的全是好货
which means you get the good stuff.

75
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,660
多谢您  那我就不客气了 反正今晚我也不回家了
Thank you very much. Don't mind if I do. I'm not going home tonight, so...

76
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,120
怎么  你和凯莉闹矛盾了?
Why? You and Cally have a fight?

77
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,460
你没听到我们吵架?  我们以为都可以卖票参观了
You didn't hear us? I figured we could have sold tickets.

78
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,090
啊…
Ah...

79
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,760
敬婚姻 这也是我们开酒吧的原因
To marriage, why we build bars.

80
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,680
对  老乔
Yeah. Joe!

81
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,850
我已经警告过你们 "睡眠剥夺"的危险性
COTTLE: I warned about the dangers of sleep deprivation.

82
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,560
精神病可以促使一个人做出怪异的举动
Psychosis can make a man do strange things.

83
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,570
波塔尔的绝食抗议对他也没好处
And Baltar's little hunger strike is not helping, either.

84
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,740
这混蛋求死心切  我看咱们就成全他
Bastard wants to die that bad, I say let him.

85
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,070
我们至少要让波塔尔开口说话
Bottom line, we need Baltar to talk.

86
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,620
如果赛昂人也看到了那个标记
If the other Cylons saw the same symbols that we saw,

87
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,910
他们可能 已经踏上去地球的路了
they could be on their way to Earth.

88
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,500
可能已经在途中设好了埋伏
They could be setting up an ambush by now.

89
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,000
我看今晚过后  他求死的决心会更大
I'm betting that after tonight, he'll be more willing.

90
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,960
医生  再等一到两个小时  我要让他有根有据
Doc, wait an hour or two. I want him cogent.

91
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,750
也别让他挨饿
I also don't want him to starve.

92
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,670
你说我能怎么办?
What do you expect me to do about it?

93
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,970
确保让他开口吃东西
I expect you to make sure he eats.

94
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,230
我会在牢房里安装监视器
I'll see about putting security cameras in that cell.

95
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,770
盖塔先生
Mr. Gaeta?

96
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,780
为什么你要在半夜去见波塔尔博士?
What exactly were you doing going to see Dr. Baltar in the middle of the night?

97
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,990
呃…
Um...

98
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,700
我睡不着
I couldn't sleep,

99
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,290
还有我觉得他可能愿意和我说话
and I guess I thought he might be willing to talk to me.

100
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,210
我们理解 就把审讯的事宜交给我们吧
We understand. Just leave his interrogation to us.

101
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,960
这是当然
Of course.

102
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,020
你熬夜了
You're up late.

103
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,150
轮机长代我向你问好
You know, the Chief says hi.

104
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,990
他也是你的酒友?
He one of your new drinking buddies?

105
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,500
我本打算请你去  可你有言在先不喜欢喝酒
You know, I would invite you, but you made it very clear it's not your thing.

106
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,620
对  可你喜欢  我又没问你这件事
No, it's your thing, and that's not what I was asking.

107
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,380
我五点起来还要去汇报
I got a briefing at 0500.

108
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,970
我们明天还一起吃晚饭吗?
Are we still on for dinner tomorrow?

109
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,550
吃啊
Yeah.

110
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,930
因为我已经和别人换班了    好
Because I already switched watches. Sure.

111
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,020
夫妻俩偶尔共进晚餐…
Just be nice for a husband and wife to occasionally...

112
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,980
当我没说
Forget it.

113
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,370
谢谢 不用关门了
Thank you. You can leave the door open.

114
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,870
是  女士
Yes, Madam.

115
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,330
你好呀
Hi.

116
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,880
这步棋走得漂亮  总统女士
Touch茅, Madam President.

117
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,760
我不想看你受罪
I have no wish to see you suffer.

118
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
是吗?
Really?

119
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,310
我刚享受完被人用一条管子从鼻子强行插进去 直达咽喉的过程
I've just had the pleasure of having a tube forced up my nose and down my throat.

120
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,270
人总要吃饭的
Everybody's got to eat.

121
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
这是为了你好
It's for your own good.

122
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,440
在新卡布里卡我们的人在你的牢房里所受的苦
And it's nothing compared to what many of our people were subjected to

123
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,940
要比这有过之而无不及
in your jail cells on New Caprica.

124
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,620
不是我的牢房 是赛昂人的
Not my jails. The Cylons'.

125
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,290
现在看来 这不过是学术讨论了  博士
An academic distinction at this point, Doctor.

126
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,950
谁都不愿意这么做
You know, none of us are enjoying this.

127
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,370
你还是老实交代吧
So why don't you just tell me what I need to know,

128
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,920
那样也就不会受这个罪了 这我可以保证
and your suffering will come to an end. And I promise you this.

129
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,090
对于赛昂人的计划或去向  我一无所知
I know nothing about the Cylons' plans or their whereabouts.

130
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,010
在那间神庙里  我什么也没看见
I witnessed nothing in that Temple.

131
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,140
毫不夸张地说 有关赛昂人的情况
My information on Cylon intelligence

132
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,440
我所知有限
is limited, to say the least.

133
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,400
在殖民地遭到袭击之前  你可曾有高级安全通行证?
Prior to the attack on the Colonies, did you have high-level security clearance?

134
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,730
有  那又怎样?  你告诉过其他人吗?
Yeah. So, what? Did you tell anybody about it?

135
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,240
你让别人登陆过国防主机吗?
Did you let someone into the defense mainframe?

136
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,410
小心了  盖尤斯
Careful, Gaius.

137
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,740
在袭击之前 我看到你和一名金发女郎在一起
The blonde woman that I saw you with on Caprica just prior to the attack?

138
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,370
她会毫不犹豫地把你扔出过渡舱
She'll flush you out of an airlock without a moment's hesitation.

139
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,670
当然  除非…  你已经不怕这些了
Unless, of course, that prospect no longer frightens you.

140
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,430
谎言
Lies.

141
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,510
还是谎言
All lies.

142
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,360
依旧在重复从前那些谎话
A rehash of all the other old lies.

143
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,360
我没有协力参与对我们同类的种族灭绝
I did not collude in the genocide of my own people.

144
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
嗯
Mmm.

145
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,510
这是德林和玛丽安・麦克勒斯特 以及他们的子女
This is Devlin and Maryanne McAllister and their son and daughter.

146
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,630
这个四口之家在家中被枪杀
This is a family of four that was gunned down

147
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,510
因为被怀疑窝藏叛乱份子...
in their own home on suspicion of harboring...

148
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,260
这不关我的事
I am not responsible. ... insurgents.

149
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,100
不知道你是否还能记住其中哪怕一张脸孔
Just wondering if you recognize even one of these faces.

150
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,970
你是否还记得
Did any image get through to you

151
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,690
当你为数不多的冒险走出…
on the rare occasion when you ventured out...

152
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,520
(我不该为被占领…)     那些沙袋掩体...    
I am not responsible... ... from behind your sand bags...

153
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,900
(负责…)      和铁丝网的时候…
...for the occupation... ... and your razor wire...

154
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,400
也不该为屠杀负责…
...any more than I am for the genocide.

155
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,320
看到你的人民所遭受的一切！ 他们是你的子民！
...to see what was happening to your people? Your people!

156
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,660
我现在就想知道!  泰上校!  进来!
I need to know! Now! Colonel Tigh, get in here!

157
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,490
把这个人给我带出去    (你不是想)
Get this man out of here. This is not about uncovering...

158
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,160
他不会交代了    (审讯出些什么)
He's not gonna talk. ... any legitimate threat.

159
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,540
把他带走 把他从最近的…
I want you to take him. I want you to toss him...

160
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,160
(你这是…)    ...过渡舱扔出去
This is about getting... ... out the nearest airlock.

161
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,670
...要公报私仇 该死的
...your pound of flesh! About frakking time.

162
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,040
守卫! 快进来
You guards, get in here, now!

163
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,460
那对我的公平审判呢?  把他给我拖出去
What happened to my fair trial? Get rid of him! Take him out of here!

164
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,670
把手拿开 别他妈的碰我!
Take your hands off me! Get your mother-frakking hands off me!

165
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,510
我要求得到公正审判!  我是殖民地公民
I demand a fair trial! I am a citizen of the Colonies,

166
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,430
我要求得到公正审判  公正审判!
and I demand a fair trial! A fair trial!

167
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,470
你给我好好看看  博士
ROSLIN: Take a good look, Doctor.

168
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,640
这些人只是被你送上刑场的人中的一小部分
These are just a fraction of the people you sent to their death.

169
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,440
正好让他们目送你  为你送行
Rather fitting they should see you take your last steps.

170
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,860
停下  等等  停下!        什么事?  什么事?
Stop! Stop! Wait! Stop! What? What!

171
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,570
你问我是否认识 这些人当中的任何一个        对!
You asked if I know any of these people. Yes!

172
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,570
我认识那个人    指出来! 指给我看!  放开他!
I know that man. Show me! Show me! Let him go!

173
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,870
放开他!  把枪举起来!
Let him go! Keep your guns on him!

174
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,040
这个人 他叫艾德里安・鲍尔
This man! His name was Adrien Bauer.

175
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,250
在卡布里卡当过我三年的实验室助理
He was my lab assistant for three years on Caprica.

176
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,620
那又怎样?!  他是杰米纳人 
So, what? He was Gemonese.

177
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,460
我帮他拿到了签证 给他介绍了女朋友
I got him a visa. I introduced him to his wife.

178
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,090
我是他第一个孩子的干爹
I am godfather to their first child.

179
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,550
我不会做出任何伤害他或他的家人 
I wouldn't do anything to harm this man or his family.

180
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,470
或其他人的家庭的事  我不是杀人犯!
Or anybody's family! I am not a murderer!

181
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,880
我是无辜的!  为什么你们不相信我!?
I am innocent! Why won't you believe me?

182
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,970
抓住他! 把他给我带出去!
Get it! Take him out here!

183
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,220
这就是你们所谓的殖民公正吗?!        把他带出去!
Is this what you call Colonial justice? GUARD: Get him up.

184
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,970
我为你所做的事呢?
What did I ever do for you, huh?

185
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,980
我他妈的救了你的命!
Only saved your bleeding life!

186
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,120
你尽力了    我明白
You gave it your best shot. I understand.

187
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,160
那杂种还是不肯说
Yeah, but the bastard still wouldn't talk.

188
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,250
不是这家伙比我想象的更有种
Either he's got more stones than I gave him credit for, or...

189
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,250
就是他知道你们在虚张声势
Or he knew you were bluffing.

190
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,670
现在该怎么处置他?
Well, what do we do with him now?

191
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,350
还有一个办法
There is one thing.

192
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,020
上将?
Admiral?

193
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,190
军方曾实验性地开展了一项采用药品介入的审讯项目
Military once ran an experimental interrogation program involving drugs.

194
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,990
确切地说  是迷幻剂
Hallucinogens, specifically.

195
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:58,120
该项目旨在营造一种异常焦虑的状态
The goal of the program was to create a state of anxiety so intense

196
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,160
迫使实验对象认为自己有生命危险
that the subject believed that their very survival was at stake.

197
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,540
审讯员可以利用这点
Interrogators would exploit that,

198
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,340
使其认为对方已经"化敌为友"
become less an adversary and more a lifeline.

199
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,640
至少是要达到这样一个目的 这么做可能会让波塔尔开口交代
At least, that was the idea. It might get Baltar to talk,

200
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,800
说出赛昂人对地球都知道些什么
tell us what the Cylons know about Earth.

201
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:21,060
但存在危险性 尤其对像波塔尔这种状态的人来说
But it's dangerous, especially for someone in Baltar's condition.

202
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,020
你是说卡拉狄加上有这种药?
Are you telling me we have these drugs aboard Galactica?

203
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,410
你可真是乐于助人
You're being awfully accommodating.

204
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,090
我们的关系  对你来说就是这样?
Is that how it looks to you?

205
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,800
你两地分居红杏出墙的贱老婆 把你叫来"速战速决"
Your estranged, two-timing bitch of a wife calls you up for a quickie,

206
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,010
然后你完事后就要走人?
and you hop on the first shuttle?

207
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,640
我看是这样
I'd say yeah.

208
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,890
我一直在考虑一些事 卡拉
I've been thinking about some stuff, Kara.

209
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,930
是吗?  什么事?
Oh, yeah? Like what?

210
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,940
像是...
Like...

211
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,530
那个疯子"整容人"李・奥本 所说的有关你
What that crazy skin job Leoben said about you

212
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,780
和你的特殊宿命的事  如果确有其事呢?
and your special destiny. What if there's something to that?

213
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,080
"卡拉・瑟瑞丝与她的特殊宿命"?
Kara Thrace and her special destiny?

214
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,960
听起来更像是一支不入流的乐队
That sounds more like a bad cover band, Sam.

215
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,670
还是想一下吧
Think about it, though.

216
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,430
如果我要弃你而去 为什么还能在卡布里卡上 
Why did I survive all of those months on Caprica, waiting for you to return,

217
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,060
坚持几个月等你回来?
if I was just gonna walk out on you?

218
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,020
而你...
And you...

219
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,640
历经磨难 被关在那栋破房子里 
I mean, did you go through that hell, locked in that fake house

220
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,980
和你那冒牌老公在一起 这样就能甩掉我了吗?
with that fake husband, just so you could ditch me?

221
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,070
我看不能
I don't think so.

222
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,610
我一想到这里的时候...
You know, when I think about it like that...

223
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,500
你爱他吗?
Do you love him?

224
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,830
什么?
What?

225
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,210
李  卡拉  你爱他吗?
Lee. Kara, do you love Lee?

226
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,630
老天  山姆--
Gods, Sam, I...

227
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,900
可能吧 不知道
Maybe. I don't know.

228
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,360
那你就要去找他
Then you gotta go to him.

229
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,700
你不是不值班么
I thought you were off duty.

230
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,570
对
I am. Yeah.

231
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,530
我正要到酒吧坐会
I was just gonna stop by the bar for a little while.

232
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,750
你要是去见卡拉  倒不如直说
If you're gonna see Kara, just admit it.

233
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,630
我已经说过我们之间没什么
Look, I told you. There's nothing going on.

234
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,420
你们都和我说...
Yeah, you both told me,

235
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,220
"李不会对你不忠的 他品德高尚"
"Lee won't cheat. He's too noble. "

236
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,970
可问题是 这都是瞎说的吧?
Only problem is, it's all a crock, isn't it?

237
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,180
你知道问题是什么吗?
You know what the only problem is?

238
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,350
问题是你不信任我  就这么简单
The only problem is that you don't trust me. That's it.

239
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,690
这都是你疑神疑鬼后的胡言乱语 一向如此
And this is just your own frakking insecurities talking, same as always.

240
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,650
从一开始就这样
I mean, right from the get-go,

241
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,650
从我向你求婚的那天早上
the very first morning that I proposed, I mean...

242
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,700
还是算了吧  说多了他妈的也没用
You know what? Forget it. This is frakking pointless.

243
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,660
对  你说对了
No. You're right.

244
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,040
这一切我早料到了
I did see this coming.

245
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,670
可我还是抱有幻想嫁给了你
And I was naive enough to marry you, anyway.

246
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,920
想知道为什么吗?  李
And you want to know why, Lee?

247
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,890
因为那时我爱你
Because I loved you.

248
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,720
太爱你了
I loved you so frakking much.

249
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,520
我以为自己是幸运的
I thought I was lucky.

250
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,940
对 撞了大运
That's right. Lucky.

251
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,940
以为只要你愿意  卡拉愿意 我就能和你长相厮守
That I could have you for just as long as you, or Kara, would let me.

252
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,120
小杜  来  过来
Dee... Come on, give me...

253
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,960
这不是婚姻  李
It's not a marriage, Lee.

254
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,050
这是谎言
This is a lie.

255
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,600
你想和卡拉在一起?  去吧
You want to be with Kara? Go ahead.

256
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
我不会碍你的事
I won't stand in your way.

257
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,940
我们之间结束了
It's over.

258
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,280
等等  你要去哪里?
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

259
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,370
山姆
Sam...

260
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,710
我得走了
I gotta get going.

261
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,720
很好
This was fun.

262
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,240
我爱你
I love you.

263
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,230
我是人  我是人  我有权利
BALTAR: I'm a human being. I'm a human being, I have rights.

264
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,060
我说过我有权利
I said I have rights.

265
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,860
求求你  救我
Please, help me.

266
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,820
我看我帮不了你  盖尤斯
I'm not sure I can, Gaius.

267
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,240
痛苦是一方面 但这样…
Pain is one thing, but this?

268
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,700
没有了自力更生的能力 你算是什么了?
Without free will, what are you?

269
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,620
神能够怜悯这样的生物吗?
Can God even pity such a creature?

270
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,500
为什么不承认你之所以这么做 是为了你的一己私欲?
Why not just admit you're doing this for your own satisfaction?

271
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,040
这才是事实  对吧?
That's the truth, isn't it?

272
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,960
为什么你不亲自来把针插进去?
I don't know why you're not putting the needle in yourself.

273
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:30,220
按住他的头    不 不 不 不
COTTLE: Hold his head. Oh, no! No! No! No! No! Oh, God!

274
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,730
他失去意识了
He's under.

275
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,320
尽量不要喧哗
Try not to make any loud noise.

276
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
把头带戴上
Put the head strap on.

277
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,750
我在哪里?
Where am I?

278
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,380
我的天  我这是在哪里?
My God, where am I?

279
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,910
什么意思?
What are you saying?

280
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,790
如果我离开山姆 你还会离开小杜吗?
If I leave Sam, will you still leave Dee?

281
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,300
天啊  卡拉
My Gods, Kara.

282
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,310
我怎么知道你明天不会来个180度的转变?
How do I know that tomorrow you're not going to pull another 180?

283
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,020
我们谈论的可他妈的是婚姻大事
I mean, these are our frakking marriages we're talking about.

284
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,940
不是儿戏啊
It's not some stupid dogfight we can just jink our way out of.

285
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,280
考虑一下吧  李 这是你的强项
Think about it, Lee. That's what you're best at.

286
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,580
我在哪里?
Where am I?

287
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,630
我的天  我在哪里?
My God, where am I?

288
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,520
能听见我说话吗?  能听见吗  博士?
ADAMA: Can you hear my voice? Can you hear me, Doctor?

289
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,270
上将  是你吗?        我在找你  博士
Admiral, is that you? I'm looking for you, Doctor.

290
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,480
找不到你 能告诉我们你在哪里吗?
I can't find you. Can you tell us where you are?

291
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,440
水
It's water.

292
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,030
我在水里 又黑又冷
I'm in the water. It's cold and it's dark.

293
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,500
我什么都看不见
I can't see anything!

294
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,750
你能看到任何可以让我们找到你的东西吗?
Is there anything you can see that can tell us where you are?

295
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,670
找灯  能看到灯吗?      能
Look for the light. Can you see the light? Yes!

296
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,630
伸手去够灯
Try to reach for the light.

297
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,260
就这样
That's it.

298
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,680
就这样
That's it.

299
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,100
跟着灯光走
Yes. Follow the light.

300
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,940
卡布里卡
Caprica.

301
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,360
卡布里卡六号
Caprica Six.

302
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,780
是她救了我 她用身体挡住了气浪
She saved my life. She shielded me from the explosion.

303
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,630
博士 是你与她共谋 破坏了我们的防御系统吗?
Doctor, did you conspire with her to subvert our defense system?

304
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,710
阴谋需要有目的
Conspiracy requires intent!

305
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,510
我从没想要…
I never intended.

306
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,930
可她说再进一步看看  我一直都有所怀疑
But she said deep down, I'd always suspected.

307
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,430
但我不知道
But I didn't know.

308
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,180
我怎么会知道?
How could I know?

309
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,890
我与她共谋了吗?  共谋了吗?
Did I conspire? Did I?

310
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,230
没有
No!

311
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,360
没有
No!

312
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,480
我不知道 不知道
I don't know. No!

313
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,820
不是我的错 不是我的错!
It wasn't my fault. It wasn't my fault!

314
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,330
不是我的责任!
I am not responsible!

315
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,300
是她…
She...

316
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,180
卡布里卡六号 她选择了我
Caprica Six, she chose me.

317
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:48,690
所有男人之中  她选择了引诱我我
Chose me over all men, chosen to be seduced.

318
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,520
牵着我的手
Taken by the hand,

319
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,400
我被领到光明与黑暗之间
guided between the light and the dark.

320
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,650
可她是天使  还是恶魔?
But is she an angel or is she a demon?

321
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,410
是虚幻的  还是真实的?
Is she imaginary or is she real?

322
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,040
她是我内心的声音吗?
Is she my own voice or the voice of...

323
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,170
我漂不住了
I can't stay afloat much longer!

324
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,260
那就告诉我们详情  博士  赛昂人的详细情况
Now give us details, Doctor. Give us details about the Cylons,

325
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,930
不然我们会让你淹死
or we'll let you drown.

326
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,890
独自在黑暗中死去
Alone, in the dark.

327
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,090
轮机长
Hey, Chief.

328
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,590
怎么他妈的就那么难?
Why is it so frakking hard?

329
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,770
我们为什么就不能恢复正常?
Why can't we just get back to normal?

330
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,560
正常?
Normal?

331
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,270
怎样才算是正常?
What is normal, anyway?

332
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,910
轮机长  如果我说得过分 你就告诉我
Now, Chief, you can tell me if I'm out of line here,

333
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,000
可是...
but...

334
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,170
你会想莎伦吗?
Do you ever think about Sharon?

335
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,180
不会
No.

336
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,770
少来了
Come on.

337
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,230
就没想过"如果"?
You never wonder, "What if?"

338
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,650
没有
No.

339
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,590
别丢下我!  我知道我有缺点 
No! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! I know I'm flawed!

340
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,220
我从没说过没有    对 错误 错误发生了  
I never claimed to be... Yes, mistakes. Mistakes were made.

341
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,470
大错特错
Terrible mistakes!

342
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,850
是我的过错吗?  只怪我一个人吗?
Were they mine? Am I solely to blame?

343
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,440
我只是一个玩家而已 一个玩家 我拼命想找到
I was a player. That's all I was, a player! I was struggling to...

344
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,810
自己在神的计划中的地位
Struggling to find my place in God's plan,

345
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,190
神的决定中的位置
God's resolve. I...

346
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,190
我从没想过会发生这种事 难道这还不行吗?
I never intended for certain things to happen! Doesn't that matter?

347
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,530
你把赛昂人带到了神庙
You took the Cylons to the Temple.

348
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,200
带到了"朱庇特之眼"那里  他们从那里得到了什么情报?
To the Eye of Jupiter. What did it tell them?

349
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,490
得到了什么有关地球的消息?
What did it tell them about Earth?

350
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,410
我不是在找…
I wasn't looking for...

351
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,790
那你在找寻什么  博士?
What were you looking for, Doctor?

352
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,210
在找寻什么?
What were you looking for?

353
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,810
他们的模样 可他们不愿意让我看到
Their faces, but they wouldn't show them to me.

354
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,360
他们的模样?  谁的模样?
Their faces? Whose faces?

355
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,150
那五个人
The Five.

356
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,490
"终极五人"
The Final Five.

357
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,240
"终极五人"?   赛昂人?
The Final Five? Cylons?

358
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,410
我本以为自己是他们中的一员
I thought I might be one of them.

359
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,380
我对他们说过 我想成为他们中的一员
I told them I wanted to be one of them.

360
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,090
成为赛昂人?  为什么?
A Cylon. Why?

361
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,760
我所有的罪过都会被宽恕
All my sins forgiven.

362
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,390
一个新的开始
A new beginning.

363
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,680
你是赛昂人吗  波塔尔博士?
Are you a Cylon, Doctor Baltar?

364
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,940
不是
No.

365
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,370
空口无凭  博士  说
That's not good enough, Doctor. Tell me.

366
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,660
你都和赛昂人说了什么?
Tell me what you told the Cylons.

367
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,210
他们都知道了什么?  告诉我 不然我就让你淹死
What do they know? Tell me, or I'll have to let you go, Doctor.

368
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:26,050
我就让你淹死 告诉我 不然我就让你淹死
I'll have to let you go. Tell me, or I'll have to let you go, Doctor.

369
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,170
我就让你淹死
I'll have to let you go.

370
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,610
瞧着点儿!
Watch where you're going.

371
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,450
我的戒指丢了
I lost my ring.

372
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,370
有人看到我的戒指了吗?  我的戒指丢了
Has anybody seen my ring? I lost my ring.

373
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,330
有人看到我的戒指了吗?
Has anybody seen my ring?

374
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,170
我的戒指丢了
I lost my ring!

375
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,690
上将!  他快不行了      够了
Admiral! We're losing him! That's enough.

376
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,020
这场荒唐的实验就到此为止吧
I'm putting an end to this freak show right now.

377
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,280
听这段
ROSLIN: Now, listen to this.

378
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,820
"五个终极型号的赛昂人
"Five final Cylon models.

379
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,950
神庙内的五根柱子对应的五位牧师
"Five Pillars of the Temple for the Five Priests

380
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,540
把生命献给了一个人 这个人的名字不可以被说出来"
"devoted to the One Whose Name Cannot Be Spoken. "

381
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,290
算了吧 这些都是天书
Come on, it's all just mumbo-jumbo.

382
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,630
他还留有好多情报没说 这我可以肯定
He's holding a lot back, Admiral. I'm sure of it.

383
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,340
可能我们要采取一些更直接的方法
Then maybe we should resort to more direct methods.

384
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,760
"直接的方法"?        我支持
Direct methods. Now you have my vote.

385
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
不
No.

386
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,680
我们威逼过了
We've tried the stick.

387
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,890
该试试利诱了
It's time to try the carrot.

388
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:05,310
我看他最担心的就是就算他交代了 我们还是会杀了他
The thing he's most deeply afraid of is that even if he talks, we'll kill him.

389
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,730
聪明人
Smart man.

390
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,650
我们必须减轻他的顾虑
We have to ease his fear.

391
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,900
让他相信如果他合作  
Make him believe that, if he collaborates,

392
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,820
至少还能保全性命
at the very least he'll have his life.

393
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,280
我们这么说  他不会相信
He won't buy that coming from us.

394
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,450
那是当然
Of course not.

395
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,950
我们必须要找一个他信任的人
We have to find someone he trusts.

396
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:33,840
说出来  可能你觉得我很变态
As perverse as it may seem,

397
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,340
但我可能真欠这些人一个人情
I may actually owe these people a debt of gratitude.

398
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:54,070
我知道也许一切都无法回头
Now, I realize there's probably nothing I can say that can make this right.

399
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,030
但有些事你有要知道
But there's something you need to know.

400
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,620
我会向你求婚 是因为我爱你
I asked you to marry me because I was in love with you.

401
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,420
就像现在我爱你一样
Just like I'm in love with you now.

402
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,000
他们强迫我...
They forced me.

403
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,460
承认我的失败
To admit my failings.

404
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,180
而现在我…  我真是觉得如释重负
And now that I have, I feel positively liberated.

405
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,430
你说得对
You were right.

406
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,560
我爱过卡拉
I loved Kara.

407
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,150
也许 我心里还会有她的位置
You know? And maybe there's a part of me that always will.

408
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,570
说心里话
In my heart,

409
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,860
我一直在做...
I know I have always done

410
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,240
我该做的事
what I've had to do.

411
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,660
但我是和你结婚
But I married you.

412
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,490
我和你结婚了
I married you.

413
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,170
回首我们的婚姻
And, you know, when I look back at our marriage,

414
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,840
我们一起走过的日子
at the time that we have spent together,

415
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,340
我们真的很般配  小杜
you are good for me, Dee.

416
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,630
我需要你
And I need you.

417
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,300
直到我快要失去你时 
And I don't think I ever really realized that

418
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,600
我才意识到这点
until I knew that I was losing you.

419
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,730
你能否得到公正审判 我无法保证  博士
I can't promise you a trial, Doctor.

420
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,230
但我确信如果你可以提供任何情报的话
I am sure that if you give them something, anything...

421
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,440
可求你 我只要求你再给我一次机会
But please just give me another chance. That's all I'm asking.

422
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,570
再给我一次机会
Just give me the chance.

423
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,880
我一直在用这些图表来设计我们前往地球的路线
These charts that I've been using to plot our course to Earth?

424
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,050
我一直对自己的运算没信心
I've never been confident about my calculations.

425
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,850
似乎这些运算是错误的
Well, that's likely because the calculations are wrong.

426
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,980
我发现一些数字不一致
I detect a number of inconsistencies right off the bat.

427
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,400
这些数字是错误的
You see, these figures here are wrong.

428
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,780
这正是我所担心的
That's exactly what I was afraid of.

429
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,830
赛昂人的导航系统远比我们的先进得多
Cylon navigation systems are far more advanced than our own,

430
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,750
但我已经记住他们的算法
but I have managed to commit many of the algorithms to memory.

431
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,210
如果我们能在这点上帮助他们
If we can offer them this kind of help,

432
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,470
我敢肯定他们至少会饶你一命
I'm certain, at the very least, they will spare your life.

433
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,680
或许我们能让你离开这牢房 
Maybe we can even get you out of this cell,

434
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,850
给你找个合适的房间
offer you some proper quarters.

435
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,000
说到底 这就是生物好逸恶劳的本性
Creature comforts, that's the clincher.

436
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,370
什么?
Sorry?

437
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,960
在哪里?
Where is it?

438
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,880
什么在哪里 博士?  "什么在哪里? "
Where is what, Doctor? "Where is what?"

439
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,860
没戏唱了
So much for that little stratagem.

440
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,320
你好
Hello.

441
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,680
嗨
Hey...

442
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,680
你还好吧?
You all right?

443
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,940
要是你不想在这里 我们这就走  好吗?
Listen, we don't have to stay here if you don't want to, okay?

444
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,610
好
Yeah.

445
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,240
两杯威士忌  倒满
Two whiskeys, straight up.

446
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,750
我早该料到是你会背叛我
I should have known that you would betray me.

447
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,330
你都告诉他们什么了?
What did you tell them?

448
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,880
在新卡布里卡的末日到来之前 你一直是幕后英雄?
That you stayed behind until the grisly end on New Caprica so you could, what?

449
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,920
如此一来才可以怎么样?
So you could...

450
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,930
给抵抗军提供情报?
You could feed information to the Resistance?

451
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,260
你以为是谁 让你如此顺心如意的?
Who do you think allowed you to do that?

452
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:37,560
你说谎    不 我没说谎 你以为我瞎了吗?
That's a lie. No, it's not a lie. You think I'm blind?

453
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,150
我之所以那么做其实是有人用枪指着我的头
You see, I literally had a gun pointed to my head.

454
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,570
可没人逼你当两面派
But nobody forced you to play both sides.

455
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,500
我问你  盖塔先生
So I'm asking you, Mr. Gaeta,

456
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,330
这房间里谁才是叛徒?
who is the real traitor in this room?

457
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,920
为未来干杯
To the first of many.

458
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,590
再来一杯?    好
Let's do another. Yeah.

459
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,160
我不是叛徒    当然不是
I am not a traitor. No, of course.

460
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,460
那是因为有些事
Because there are... There are far worse things

461
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,000
比叛变更严重 对吧  菲里克斯?
than being a traitor, aren't there, Felix?

462
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,880
只要让你的朋友知道了真相
If your friends only knew the truth.

463
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,300
别担心 那是我们之间的小秘密
Don't worry. It's our little secret.

464
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,970
我们得马上过去
We've gotta get in there.

465
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,680
离开我
Get away from me!

466
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,810
去你妈的!
Frak you!

467
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,070
盖塔中尉 立即离开犯人
GUARD: Lieutenant Gaeta. Step away from the prisoner, now.

468
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,490
离开犯人 这是最后警告
Step away from the prisoner! I will not ask you again!

469
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,280
放下枪  中士        是  长官
Stand down, Sergeant. Yes, sir.

470
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,580
退后  盖塔先生        不行  长官
Step back, Mr. Gaeta. No. No! No, sir!

471
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,420
他恶贯满盈 我不能放过他
I can't... I can't let him live. Not after what he's done.

472
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,090
盖塔先生 盖塔先生  请等等 看着我
Mr. Gaeta? Mr. Gaeta, wait. Please. Look at me.

473
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,260
我理解你的感受
I understand what you're feeling.

474
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,590
不  你不理解        不  我理解
GAETA: No, you don't. Yes, I do.

475
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,260
那天晚上 你不是来审问波塔尔博士
The other night, you didn't come here to interrogate Doctor Baltar.

476
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,810
而是来杀他的  对吧?        我理解  真的
You came here to kill him, didn't you? I understand that. I do.

477
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,520
他的伤势如何?        没伤到动脉  死不了
What's his condition? He missed the artery. He'll live.

478
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,530
最好把他送到医务室 快取个担架过来
We've got to get him to sick bay. Get a gurney in here right away.

479
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,400
慢点
ROSLIN: Go easy on him.

480
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,660
都考虑周全了 盖尤斯  否则结果可能更糟糕
NO. 6: All things considered, Gaius, it could have been worse.

481
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,500
糟糕的很
Much worse.

482
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,130
虽然你不是五人之一
Well, you're not one of the Five.

483
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,880
但你还是得到了神的庇佑
You certainly have the luck of the Gods.

484
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,970
不  我是被神选中的人
Well, I am the Chosen One.

485
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,050
你没和他们说这些  对吧?
You didn't tell them that, did you?

486
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,390
没有
No.

487
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,600
每个人都有秘密
Everybody's got to have a secret.

488
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,740
我告诉他看到他受罪 我并不感到满足
I told him I didn't take any satisfaction in seeing his pain.

489
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:46,500
可其实为了达到目的 我很愿意 
But the truth is, I was willing to see him endure a great deal of suffering

490
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,790
看到他痛苦煎熬的样子
in order to get what I wanted.

491
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,170
并不是想要得到什么情报 或是什么真相
It wasn't some intelligence or some truth.

492
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,090
我只想看到他 为自己所犯的罪行而真正地内疚
I wanted a genuine admission of guilt.

493
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:04,310
从波塔尔这种人身上 你不会得到这些
That's something that you're not gonna get from someone like Baltar.

494
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,270
他自己可不那么认为
He doesn't see himself that way.

495
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,400
他不是那种人
That's not who he is.

496
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,360
在他看来  他才是受害者
In his eyes, he's the victim,

497
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,110
而非罪犯
not the criminal.

498
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,330
现在让他就此消失还为时不晚
It's not too late for him to just disappear.

499
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,170
我们不能那么做
We can't do that.

500
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,180
他始终是我们中的一员
For all his crimes, he's one of us.

501
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,010
那下一步怎么办?
So, what happens next?

502
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,100
让他得到公正的审判
We give him his trial.
