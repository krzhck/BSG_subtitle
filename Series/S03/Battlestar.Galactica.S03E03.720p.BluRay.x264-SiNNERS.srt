1
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,190
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》 前情提要
SAM: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,150
我实在搞不明白 在我被关押了几星期后  
I can't figure it. All those weeks in detention

3
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,360
忽然他们就把放我出来了
and then suddenly, they let me out.

4
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,030
我需要造反领导们
I want a specific place, I want a specific time

5
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,950
每一次高级会议的具体地点和具体时间
for a very high-level meeting of the insurgency leadership.

6
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,240
如果我们得不到  我们会再次把少抓回来
And if I don't get it, we pick up Saul again,

7
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,410
而这次  他失去的就不止是一只眼睛
and this time he'll lose more than an eye.

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,830
我们必须不惜一切代价来保护这孩子
DORAL: The child's life must be protected at all costs.

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,040
第一个赛昂人与人类的混种
D'ANNA: The first Cylon-human hybrid.

10
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,460
这真是上帝赐予的奇迹
It truly is a miracle from God.

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,050
我们失去她了
We lost her.

12
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,590
我们尽力了...但她还是死了
We did the best we could, but she's dead

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,140
就这样结束了
and that's all there is to it.

14
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,640
她是那么美丽
She's so beautiful.

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,270
你要明白  玛雅  这次收养要绝对保密
You understand, Maya, that this adoption requires absolute secrecy.

16
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,350
我向你保证
You have my word.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,270
每天都有猛禽战机
TIGH: There's a Raptor out there every day,

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,980
在外轨道监听无线电信号
listening for a wireless call,

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,820
它会在那里等着  因为那个老头子
and it's out there because the old man

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,690
不会把我们留给赛昂人
isn't just gonna leave us to the Cylons!

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,950
"我们会用这个频率每12小时联系一次"
"Will make contact this frequency every 12 hours.

22
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,240
"坚持住  我们来接你们了"
"Have hope. We're coming for you. "

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,780
赛昂人已经把着陆的殖民飞船上的…
The Cylons have removed launch keys

24
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,370
启动钥匙转移了 地点未知
from grounded Colonial ships, location unknown.

25
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,910
最佳选择是安排地面上的人
The best option is that Saul and the people on the ground

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,170
让他们找回原来的启动钥匙
get their hands on the original launch keys.

27
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,920
上将决定派些人下到地面去
DUALLA: The Admiral's decided to put some boots on the ground.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,800
想要派一名军官下去
He wants to send an officer as a liaison

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,670
充当我们与抵抗组织之间的联络人
between us and the resistance elements

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,670
来协调救援行动
on the planet to coordinate the rescue op.

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,220
很合理  有什么问题?
It makes sense. What's the problem?

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,680
问题是派谁下去
It's who he's sending.

33
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,720
整个计划是一次不计后果的赌博
This entire plan is a reckless gamble.

34
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,770
你在拿整个人类种族冒险
You are risking the lives of the entire human race.

35
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,690
你应利用帕伽索斯和民用船只上的资源
You should make plans to resume the search for Earth

36
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,810
尽快制定寻找地球的计划
with Pegasus and the civilian fleet.

37
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,980
而我要回去
But I'm going back.

38
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,030
我们围捕那些反叛军的领袖然后公开处决他们
We round up the leaders of the insurgency and we execute them publicly.

39
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,910
我们在街上随便抓一些人
CAVIL: We round up at random groups

40
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,870
然后公开处决他们
off the street and we execute them publicly.

41
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,620
放出消息说刽子手来了
Send a message that the gloves are coming off.

42
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,290
叛乱必须立即停止
The insurgency stops now

43
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,660
否则我们就开始减少人口数量
or else we start reducing the human population

44
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,920
让人数降到一个更有利于管理的水平
to a more manageable size.

45
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,430
让他们出来活动一下吧
Let them stretch their legs for a minute.

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,930
好了  所有人出来
JAMMER: All right, everybody out!

47
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,020
所有人出来!5分钟休息
Five minute rest break!

48
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,350
快点
Come on, move!

49
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,280
你 到这来
You, over here.

50
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,410
跑
Run.

51
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,620
跑!别回头看  快
Run, don't look back. Go!

52
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,450
我来帮你吧!
ELLEN: Can I help you?

53
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,540
不
No.

54
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,290
这样就行了
ELLEN: There we go.

55
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,380
谢谢
TIGH: Thanks.

56
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,010
对不起         没事  这不要紧
Sorry. No, that's all right. It doesn't hurt.

57
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,550
我很感激你这么做
Now, I appreciate you doing this.

58
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,300
我从镜子看这里就是找不准地方
I can't seem to get it right in the mirror.

59
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,050
少
Saul.

60
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,020
我想让你知道
I want you to know

61
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,230
为了你  我可以做任何事
that I would do anything for you.

62
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,980
是
Yeah.

63
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,360
名单
The list,

64
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,950
凯莉在名单上  他们会杀了她的
Cally's on the list. They're gonna kill her.

65
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,070
什么名单?他们要杀了她?
What list? They're gonna kill her.

66
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,490
你到底在说什么?
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,030
我刚拿到这个
I got this.

68
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,490
我从处决档案上拿到这个
I got this from the dead drop,

69
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,080
是从管理部门的线人那里得来的
from the source in the administration.

70
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,710
这是张死亡名单  而凯莉的名字就在上面
It's a death list and Cally's name is on it.

71
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,000
他们在城市里抓人
They're rounding up people in the city

72
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,960
凯莉已经被逮捕了
and Cally's already in the detention.

73
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,170
他们随时都可以将她拉出来 
They could take her out at any minute...

74
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,430
他们通过车辆把她运出去
They've got this organized by transport vehicles.

75
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,930
凯莉就在前往地图坐标X-Ray 7的那群人里
Cally's in a group heading for map coordinate X-ray-7...

76
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,390
我知道  但他妈的到底在哪里?
I know. Where the frak is that?

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,930
我的意思是  我们怎么才能够...
I mean, how are we gonna...

78
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,060
冷静下来  该死的
Calm down, damn it!

79
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,730
军士长  你一定要冷静思考  不然她会死掉的
You've got to start thinking clearly, here, Chief, or she's dead.

80
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,730
现在我们已经搞明白他们的地图坐标系统的使用方法
Now, we've already figured out their map coordinate system.

81
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,110
应该与你搞到的死亡档案的…
It's referred to in the list of Cylon freqs

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,530
赛昂通讯频率表有关
you got from the last dead drop.

83
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,490
真他妈的伟大!你说对了
Holy frak, you're right.

84
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,450
我能推断出坐标...
I can extrapolate the coordinate system...

85
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,870
押送凯莉的那队人必须…
TIGH: Cally's group has to pick up

86
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,290
先在城镇里集合队伍
a bunch of people in town first.

87
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,540
那要花费一些时间
That'll take time.

88
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,710
带四个人去那里  抢在那些卡车前头
Take four men and get there ahead of the trucks.

89
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,290
军士长  小心点!
Chief! Pull it together.

90
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,210
如果你也被抓了  这对她没任何好处
You won't do her any good if you get caught, too.

91
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,550
而且  最终  你儿子的父母只能是我和艾伦
Besides, the last thing your son wants is me and Ellen for parents.

92
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,140
去找到名单 军士长
Find that list, Chief.

93
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
该死的到底在哪?
Frak! Where the frak is it? I know it's...

94
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,960
该死!真该死!
Damn it! Gods damn it!

95
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,590
该死的名单到底在哪?
Where's the frakking list?

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,460
应该在这儿  应该在这儿
Okay, it's gotta be in here. It's gotta be.

97
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,180
我干了些什么 就是它
What did I do with it? That's it.

98
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,640
在这里 太好了
That's it, okay.

99
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,720
名单呢
Where's the list?

100
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,480
见鬼 快
Damn it! Come on!

101
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,940
在这儿 好 X-ray-7-1-4-3…
Here it is. Okay, X-ray-7-1-4-3...

102
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,870
嗨  军士长  这真是个散步的好日子  对吧?
Hey, Chief. Good day for a walk, huh?

103
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,990
把你的人集合起来  
TYROL: Get two men together.

104
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,540
我们要去普加马斯平地
We're going to Pergamus Flats.

105
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,150
情况如何  格尼
Talk to me, Gunny.

106
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,400
不对劲  少尉
I don't like it, Eltee.

107
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,400
沿着这痕迹太容易中埋伏了
Too much cover along this trail.

108
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,530
我们会在那里...那里...还有那里 遭到扫射炮火
We could catch enfilade fire from there, there, and along there.

109
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,700
我们走吧
Let's move out.

110
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,330
我要到汇合点
I'm going to the rendezvous point.

111
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,370
派你的人在山脊上掩护
Place your men on the ridge for cover.

112
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,940
走吧  黑豹们!
Go, Panthers!

113
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,190
C-Bucks规则!
C- Bucks rule!

114
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,220
嗨  山姆  好久不见
Hey, Sam, it's been a while.

115
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,640
真有趣  我觉得每天都看见你似的
Funny, I feel like I see you every day.

116
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,020
来吧  我们走
Come on.

117
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,780
是那些卡车
TYROL: There's trucks.

118
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,950
让他下到山脊去 
Tell him to move down to the ridge.

119
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,580
下到山脊去
Move down to the ridge.

120
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,160
克里斯平  听到了吗
Crispick, did you hear?

121
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,540
就是这里了  子弹上膛  打开保险
This is it. Lock and load.

122
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,510
来吧  看看我们能看到什么!
All right, what do we see?

123
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,890
噢  该死的
TYROL: Oh, frak me.

124
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,180
什么?
SEELIX: What?

125
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,730
他们抓了劳拉・罗丝琳  还有汤姆・查莱克
They've got Laura Roslin and Tom Zarek with them.

126
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,520
看到凯莉了吗?
Is there any sign of Cally?

127
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,440
还没有
Not yet.

128
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,730
卡拉狄加计划了营救任务  并即将执行
All right, so Galactica's got a rescue plan in place and ready to go.

129
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,150
我的任务是 
My job is to get the launch keys

130
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,690
找到还留在地面上的民用船只的启动钥匙
for the civilian ships still on the ground

131
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,360
然后根据你们的撤退计划  调整营救任务
and then coordinate the rescue mission with your evacuation plan.

132
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,910
我们什么时候与泰上校见面?
When can we meet with Colonel Tigh?

133
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,160
我们要等到天黑了
We're gonna wait until nightfall

134
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,910
才能回到市内
before we head back into the city.

135
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,670
找到她了 找到她了
Oh, there she is. There she is.

136
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,500
噢  谢谢上帝  找到她了
Oh, my Gods, there she is.

137
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,670
该死的她在干吗?
What the frak's she doing?

138
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,050
她在想办法逃出来
She's making a run for it.

139
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,220
那些铁皮人排成了一列
The bulletheads are lining up.

140
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,520
那是攻击方队
TYROL: It's a firing squad.

141
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,150
瞄准那些赛昂武士  马上!
Sight in on the Centurions, right now.

142
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,020
凯莉在我们的攻击线上
Cally's right in the line of fire.

143
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,940
如果我们开火  会打伤她的
If we shoot, we're gonna hit her.

144
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,110
倒数5 开火
Then count to five and open fire.

145
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,370
有两个人形赛昂
CHEADLE: Two skin jobs.

146
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,580
我们要把他们干掉吗?
Should we take them down?

147
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,580
哪里有人形赛昂  那里就有铁皮人
MATHIAS: Where there are skin jobs, there are bulletheads.

148
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,450
把火箭筒拿来
Bring up the RPG.

149
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,250
这里有一些下水道
SAM: Now, there's a system of tunnels

150
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,420
我们以前用过...
we've been using that run parallel to the...

151
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,050
你们听到了吗?
You hear that?

152
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,630
快!快撤         找掩护
SAM: Go! Go! Move! MAN: Get down there!

153
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,220
别停留
ATHENA: Don't stay!

154
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,310
都出去
Everyone get out!

155
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,430
快 快 快
Go! Go! Go! Go!

156
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,140
躲到树丛后面
Get in line behind the tree line!

157
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,230
1001码  1002码…
One thousand one, one thousand two,

158
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,400
1003码...
one thousand three,

159
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,400
1004码...
one thousand four,

160
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,240
1005码
one thousand five...

161
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,200
低下  走
MAN 1: Get down! Go!

162
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,750
在树后面
MAN 2: Behind the trees!

163
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,750
该死的  我们要离开这里
Frak this. We've got to get out of here.

164
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,750
待着别动  相信我
Stay put. Trust me.

165
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,420
就是现在!
MATHIAS: Now.

166
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,430
谢谢
Thanks.

167
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,890
他们在等我们  中尉  就在我们约好的地方
They were waiting for us, Eltee, right where we thought.

168
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,140
山姆  你最好看看这个
CONNOR: Sam, you'd better take a look at this.

169
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,850
我在一个人形赛昂身上找到的
I found it on a dead skin job.

170
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,650
这是你的笔迹  对吧?
It's your handwriting, isn't it?

171
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,860
没错  还真他妈的是
Yeah, you're damn right it is.

172
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,570
我们被出卖了
SAM: We were sold out.

173
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,450
是艾伦
Ellen.

174
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,740
检查下 确保他们都没事
INSURGENT: Check them out. Make sure they're okay.

175
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,880
你还好吧  汤姆?
You all right, Tom?

176
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,170
还好
Yeah.

177
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,670
自从有个女人把我打倒以后
It's been a while since I had a woman throw me to the ground.

178
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,680
我就不认为这有多有趣了
Not quite as much fun as I remember.

179
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,020
很痛  对吧  太好了
It hurts, huh? Good.

180
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,980
那么我希望会痛很长很长时间  
And I hope it hurts a long, long time

181
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,860
直到你重新去下载地
until you go to Download City.

182
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,750
你们在下面好吗?
You all right down there?

183
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,370
噢  天呀
Oh, my Gods!

184
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,540
见到你真好  军士长
It's good to see you, Chief.

185
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,550
我也很高兴见到你  女士
It's good to see you too, ma'am.

186
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,090
现在发生了什么?我们要去哪里?
What happens now? Where do we go from here?

187
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,890
我们要回家  我们要回家了
We're going home. We're going home.

188
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,220
阿达玛上将已经上路了
Admiral Adama's on his way.

189
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,770
我们度过这个困难时期后就要回到卡拉狄加了
We're getting off this rock, we're going back to Galactica.

190
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,210
别担心  盖尤斯  没事的
Don't worry about it, Gaius. It's all right.

191
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,380
这对我真的无所谓
It doesn't matter to me, really.

192
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,300
你能否马上闭嘴  行不?
You can stop that right now, okay?

193
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,010
我的自负还没到如此脆弱的地步
My ego's not so fragile as all that.

194
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,980
这些事情发生了或者他们没有发生
These things happen or they don't happen.

195
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,650
所以我们应该说什么好呢?
So what shall we talk about?

196
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,820
我们可以说说你过的日子吗?
Shall we talk about your day?

197
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,370
亲爱的  你的日子过得如何?
How was your day, darling?

198
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,750
你在办公室里的日子如何?
How was your day at the office?

199
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,840
我的办公室
My office.

200
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,630
有消息吗?
Any news?

201
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,090
没有
No?

202
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,510
好吧  那让我告诉你我过得如何
Well, let me tell you about my day,

203
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,020
因为过得一团糟
because it was a hoot.

204
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,400
我与其中一个得罗有过令人醉心的聊天
I had the most fascinating chat with one of the Dorals.

205
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,320
他有过一个卫生间是人类重获 
He's got this theory about sanitation being the key

206
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,200
自信与互信的钥匙的理论
to regaining human trust and confidence,

207
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,290
像是与厕纸相关
something about toilet paper.

208
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,120
不  短缺的厕纸.就是这个
No, lack of toilet paper, that's it.

209
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,790
如果人们能够擦干净他们的屁股
How if people could only wipe their bums properly,

210
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,550
在投票时选票数量一定会有客观的增加
there'd be a measurable up-tick in the polls.

211
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,010
四个月了  盖尤斯
Four months of this, Gaius.

212
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,390
四个月以来看着你越滑越远
Four months I'm watching you slip further and further

213
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,600
到这般自我憎恨与厌恶的地步
down into this well of self-hatred and loathing.

214
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,230
你知道我为你放弃了什么吗?
Do you know what I've given up for you?

215
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,570
你知道吗?
Do you?

216
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,490
你知道吗  由于这次占领与众多事情的原因
Gee, dear, what with the occupation and everything,

217
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:38,370
我真的不能说我最近能够思考这些东西
I can't really say I've given it that much thought recently.

218
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,500
别走
Don't go.

219
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,010
求求你
Please.

220
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,000
那看起来也没那么糟
It doesn't look so bad.

221
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,810
我有些话想对你说
Hey, there's something that I wanted to say to you.

222
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,520
我真的很抱歉把你一个人留下来
I'm sorry that I left you alone.

223
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,820
我不是故意想让你受伤害
I didn't mean for you to get hurt.

224
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,490
我对自己很失望而不是你  可以了吧?
I was upset with myself and not you, okay?

225
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,410
长大的过程中往往会做一些愚蠢的事
Grown-ups do stupid things sometimes.

226
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,960
我们还来得及找回我们之间的小世界
We get caught up in our own little world until it's almost too late.

227
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,430
你完全不知道我在对你说什么  对吧?
You have no idea what I'm saying to you, do you?

228
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,020
好了  是时候睡觉了
Okay, time to take a nap.

229
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,420
别担心  我知道你是谁  你是什么
Don't be afraid. I know who you are, what you are.

230
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,260
可怜的东西
Poor thing.

231
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,270
你一定被吓坏了
You must be terrified.

232
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,240
你有糖吗?
Do you have any candy?

233
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,450
糖?
Candy?

234
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,200
没有
No.

235
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,500
粗糠柴太苦了 (译者注:粗糠柴-一种亚洲树木  结多毛)
Kamala's so bitter.

236
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,090
宙斯无所不知
Oh, Zeus sees all.

237
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,590
看见你  3号
Sees you, Number Three.

238
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,180
能了解你的痛苦  
Sees your pain,

239
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,390
你的命运
your destiny.

240
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,060
所有神会都为你哭泣的
All the Gods weep for you.

241
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,940
但宙斯不会  除了上帝  没有其他的神
There is no Zeus. No other God but God.

242
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,070
看来  你已经不再相信了
Well, you don't believe that anymore.

243
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,900
你不知道你的信仰是什么 这也是你来到这里的原因
You don't know what you believe and that is why you're here.

244
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,490
不是这样的
It's not true.

245
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,990
我甚至不知道我为何要来这里
I don't even know why I'm here.

246
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,580
这是我干过的最蠢的事
This is the stupidest thing I ever did.

247
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,910
是你的梦把你带到我这里
It is your dream that brings you to me.

248
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,000
你是怎么知道的?
How do you know about that?

249
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,510
我在你所信仰的神那里得到了一条给你的信息
I have a message for you from the one you worship.

250
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,840
他通过我与你谈话
He speaks through me to you,

251
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,100
正如他在你的梦里说的那样
just as he speaks in your dreams.

252
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,930
那条信息是...
The message is,

253
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,860
两个人的(爱情)之果还活在世上
the fruit born of two peoples is alive.

254
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,070
一个以全知的宙斯的
A child named after the wife and sister

255
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,610
妻子和姐妹名字命名的孩子
of the all-knowing Zeus,

256
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,780
赫拉还活着 (译者注:赫拉是宙斯的妻子)
Hera, lives.

257
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,740
那不是真的
It's not true.

258
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,950
孩子死了
The child is dead.

259
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,500
你会把她抱在怀里的
You will hold her in your arms

260
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,420
而你也会第一次知道
and you'll know for the first time

261
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,340
什么才是真爱的感觉
what it is to feel true love,

262
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,720
但你会失去你在这里的所有一切
but you'll lose everything you've done here.

263
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,390
真希望我能有一些巧克力糖
Wish I had some chocolate caramels.

264
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,200
我们走吧!  在下面还有一些兄弟在等我们
Let's move! We've got some people waiting for their ride down there!

265
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
你能否不再那样看我?
Will you quit looking at me like that?

266
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,920
我怎样看你了?
Like what?

267
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,090
你知道你是怎样看我的
You know "like what. "

268
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,920
就像我们将要永别了那样
Like we're never gonna see each other again?

269
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,260
我们会再见面的  这是个好计划  杜
We will. It's a good plan, Dee.

270
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,600
保护好上将
Take care of the Admiral.

271
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,680
保护好他的儿子
Take care of his son.

272
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,980
各就各位  兄弟们  你们都知道的
HELO: All right, people, you know how this works.

273
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,940
帕伽索斯船员站在这条线左边
Pegasus crew on the port side of the line,

274
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,780
卡拉狄加的站在右边
Galactica on the right.

275
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,850
他们的敌人决意将他们分开
RACETRACK: "Their enemies will divide them,

276
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,520
他们的家园在炽热的火焰中毁灭
"their colonies broken in the fiery chasm of space.

277
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,940
他们明亮的天空被漫漫长夜所替代
"Their shining days renounced by a multitude of dark sacrifices.

278
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,280
但他们将永远在一起
"Yet still they will remain, always together. "

279
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,240
永不分开
ALL: Always together.

280
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,830
集结点见
CREWMAN 1: See you at the rendezvous point.

281
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,080
保重
CREWMAN 2: You'd better.

282
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,840
坚持住我们会…
CREWMAN 3: Hang onto this until we get out of this...

283
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,550
我会回来的
CREWMAN 4: I'll be back before you know it.

284
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,850
那边见 兄弟
CREWMAN 5: See you on the other side, man.

285
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,350
我会等你回来
CREWMAN 6: I'll hold you to that.

286
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,470
回头见…
CREWMAN 7: I'll see you.

287
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,640
回头见…
CREWMAN 8: I'll see you...

288
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,020
上帝保佑
CREWMAN 9: May the Gods...

289
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,980
这是你第三次看手表了
That's the third time you've taken a look at your watch.

290
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,690
有约会?
Got dinner plans?

291
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,160
没有  我只是在想...
No, I'm just...

292
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,910
莎伦现在应该在地面上了
I was just thinking Sharon's probably on the ground by now.

293
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,290
我知道
I know.

294
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,790
这是你的命令
These are your orders.

295
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,420
你会找到汇合点的
You'll find the rendezvous point there.

296
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,210
带上这些平民船只 等我18小时
Take the civilian fleet, wait for me for 18 hours.

297
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,630
如果18小时后我没回来  那就去找地球
If I'm not back in 18 hours, then find Earth.

298
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,180
好吧
Yeah, right.

299
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,770
我会在汇合点和你见面的
I'll see you at the rendezvous point.

300
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,810
18小时后  尽量别迟到了
Eighteen hours. Try not to be late.

301
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,610
我越来越老了  也越来越迟钝了
I'm getting old and I'm a little slow.

302
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,730
但我会赶到的
But I'll be there.

303
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,570
老天  我真希望我能说服你别去
Gods, I wish I could talk you out of this.

304
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,240
你办不到
You can't.

305
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,990
你试过了
You tried.

306
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,040
你知道吗  老爸...
You know, Dad...

307
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,250
别说了
Don't.

308
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,630
别让我在自己的停机坪上大哭
Don't make me cry on my own hangar deck.

309
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,190
我会在那见到你的
See you there.

310
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,980
请允许离开你的船  上将
Permission to leave your ship, Admiral.

311
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,740
请求批准  指挥官
Permission granted, Commander.

312
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,870
立正!
Attention!

313
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,540
帕伽索斯指挥官 出发
Commander of Pegasus, departing.

314
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,340
18小时后
Eighteen hours.

315
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,540
嗨  杰克  嗨  杰克
Hey, Jake. Hey, Jake.

316
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,470
你不关心我是谁  对吗?
Yeah, you don't care who I am, do you?

317
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,090
我们在你眼中都是神的子民
We're all God's creatures in your eyes.

318
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,850
对吗
Here you go.

319
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,520
好小子      睡不着?
Good boy. Can't sleep?

320
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,190
恶梦
Bad dreams.

321
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,520
还不知道你这类人也会做梦
I didn't know you people had dreams.

322
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,940
当然
Oh, sure.

323
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,110
每个人都会做梦  医生
Yeah, everybody dreams, Doc.

324
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,370
那是人类还是赛昂人的血?
Is that human or Cylon blood?

325
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,330
赛昂人
Cylon.

326
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,040
今天  其中一个5号被起义军漂亮地击中了
One of the Fives got pretty shot up today by the insurgents.

327
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,880
但他能撑过来
He's gonna make it.

328
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,380
你可以让他好好地享受下痛苦
You could have let him suffer.

329
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,880
那不是我要做的
It's not what I do.

330
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,510
那个婴儿又如何?
What about the baby?

331
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,180
莎伦的孩子 赫拉
Sharon's baby, Hera?

332
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,890
当那个小孩在卡拉狄加死去的时候
When that child died on Galactica,

333
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,770
你为何火化了尸体?
why did you cremate the body?

334
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,360
那是第一个人类与赛昂人的混血儿
It's the first Cylon-human hybrid

335
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,740
而你却把她扔进了焚化炉
and you threw it in the incinerator?

336
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,200
不是我做的决定
Oh, it wasn't my decision.

337
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,070
是总统的要求
That was the president's call.

338
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,040
我只是遵守命令而已
I was just following orders.

339
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,050
这真是很有意思
That's a very funny thing.

340
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,970
这些玩意看起来一模一样
Because this stuff all looks the same.

341
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,490
她说
She said,

342
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:29,950
"那么我希望会痛很长很长时间  直到你重新去下载地"
"I hope it hurts you for a long, long time before you go to Download City. "

343
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,960
然后他们就离开了我
And then they just left me there.

344
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,300
他们就在烈日下  留下了中弹的我
They left me in the hot sun with a bullet in my guts.

345
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,420
多么高尚的种族呀!
What a noble race you are.

346
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,430
在你死之前  在那待了多久?
BOOMER: How long were you there before you died?

347
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,060
几个小时
CAVIL: Hours.

348
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,060
后来  我设法
Eventually, I managed to drag myself

349
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,310
翻身找到一些弹片
over to some spent shell casings

350
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,820
我用其中一片割断了我的颈动脉
and I used one of those to scratch open my carotid artery.

351
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,650
皮肤比你们想象的要坚韧得多
Skin is a lot tougher than you think.

352
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,950
现在...这是我的第三次下载
Now that's three for me, three downloads.

353
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,990
第一次  我只是被爆了头但我还能忍受  
The first one I just got a headache, but I could handle it.

354
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,120
现在  越来越糟了
Now it's worse and worse.

355
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,250
现在的感觉
This time it was like

356
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,500
就像该死的烧红了的铁棒穿过我的头骨
a frakking white-hot poker through my skull.

357
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,630
不值得  完全不值得
It's not worth it. None of this is worth it.

358
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,590
他是对的  你知道
He's right, you know.

359
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,340
不值得
It's not worth it,

360
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,800
这就是我一直以来告诫你们的  我所相信的
which is what I believe I've been telling you all along.

361
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,640
卡布里卡  你能让他闭嘴吗?
Caprica, can you please control him...

362
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,010
你何不向我开枪
Why don't you just shoot me

363
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,930
如果那样能改变现状
if that would remedy the situation?

364
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,310
我们需要更强硬的措施
DORAL: We need to crack down harder.

365
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,600
怎么做?
How?

366
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,900
我们已经无计可施了
Our resources are stretched to the max already.

367
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,860
我不想再听这些了
I don't need to listen to this anymore.

368
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,650
以前我们通常是很容易达成一致的
Consensus used to be so easy.

369
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,530
但现在看看它们都给我们带来了什么?
Now look what they've done to us.

370
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,910
不要失去希望
But don't lose hope.

371
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,870
如果情况越来越糟 我们可以用核武器攻击并摧毁城市
Worse comes to worst, we can always nuke the city and be done with it.

372
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,970
最好将那牌子留下
You'd better leave those dog-tags here.

373
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,800
他们一看到  就知道你是谁了
If they spot them, they'll know who you are.

374
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,720
不  你不知道我为这玩意付出了多少努力
No. You have no idea how hard I worked for these.

375
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,140
我们估计启动钥匙最有可能
So, our best guess puts the launch keys

376
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,980
被放在了拘留所的某处
somewhere in the detention center.

377
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,520
你最好沿在主街道走
Now just keep to the main streets, okay?

378
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,060
所有人都认为你只不过是一个普通的人形赛昂
Everybody will think you're just a regular skin job

379
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,320
他们会避开你
and they'll avoid you,

380
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,150
但也有很多人会乘机
but there's a lot of people out there looking

381
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,030
干掉一个闲逛着的毫无防备的赛昂人
to gut an unwary Cylon going for a stroll,

382
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,700
所以  别让任何人靠近到足以捅你一刀的地方
so don't let anybody get close enough to stick a knife in you.

383
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,160
好的  谢谢提醒
All right, thanks for the concern.

384
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,700
这让我不知所措
Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

385
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,790
你准备怎样找到那些启动钥匙?
How are you gonna find those launch keys?

386
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,410
我混进去后  接入数据流
When I get inside and hook into the data stream,

387
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,000
就能知道位置了
it'll feed me the location.

388
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,170
一旦我拿到钥匙  你需要将他们分发到那些
And once I get the keys, you need to distribute them to the pilots

389
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,290
能将那些飞船飞走的机师手里
who can fly those ships out of here.

390
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,460
我们已经准备好了  机师们都在等着
We're already on it. We've got pilots standing by.

391
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,460
安德斯    嗨…
CONNOR: Anders? MAN: Hey...

392
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,090
进来吧
SAM: Yeah, come in.

393
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,300
天呀!  她在这里干什么
My Gods, what is she doing here?

394
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,390
把她带下去  
Get her down below

395
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,600
关起来  直到审讯她
and you keep her there until after the next briefing.

396
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,640
等会
ELLEN: Wait a minute.

397
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,020
不要  不要  等等  听我说  我可以解释
No, no. No, wait. Listen to me please. I can explain...

398
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,850
我建议你把嘴巴闭上
SAM: Now, I suggest you keep your mouth shut.

399
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,650
我丈夫在哪?
ELLEN: Where is my husband?

400
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,860
我要和我丈夫说话
I want to speak to my husband.

401
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,110
康纳  我们走吧     带她下去
SAM: Connor, let's go. Get her down.

402
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,440
来吧
Come on.

403
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:12,910
好了  我走了
Okay, I'm out of here.

404
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,030
等等  莎伦
SAM: Wait, Sharon...

405
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,280
什么事?
Yeah.

406
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,040
帮我个忙  留意下星芭
Do me a favor and just keep an eye out for Starbuck.

407
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,290
我不知道她是生是死
I don't know if she's alive or if she's dead,

408
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,800
已经有4个月没见到她了
but it's been four months.

409
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,300
我会尽力的
I'll do what I can.

410
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,220
谢谢
Yeah.

411
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,270
你们要不惜一切把这孩子藏好
ROSLIN: You must keep the child hidden at all costs.

412
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,570
我们让她与其他重要目标一起走
SAM: We keep her on the move, along with other high-value targets.

413
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,780
她不会在同一地方待
She'll never stay in any one location

414
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,070
超过2到3天
longer than two or three days.

415
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,870
山姆  我要你认真听我说
Sam, I need you to really hear me on this.

416
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,580
非常认真地
Really.

417
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:06,040
这里没有人  没有任何人比玛雅和她的小孩更重要
There is no one, no one, of higher value than Maya and her child.

418
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,130
我们不能让他们落入赛昂人手中
We cannot let them fall into Cylon hands.

419
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,550
我知道了
I get it.

420
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,680
你想让我走多远?
How far do you want me to go?

421
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,230
我意思是  如果有赛昂人要来抓她的迹象
I mean, if it looks like the Cylons are gonna capture them...

422
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,350
不
No,

423
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,440
别让事情发展到这一步 就这么多了
don't let it get to that point. That's all.

424
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,070
我不指望你告诉我这个中原由是什么
I don't suppose you're gonna tell me what this is all about.

425
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,070
我意思是  这孩子有多重要
I mean, what's so important about this kid?

426
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,870
她在将来可能十分重要
She may very well be the shape of things to come.

427
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,120
也许是祝福  也可能是诅咒
That's either a blessing or a curse.

428
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,800
我知道
I know.

429
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,750
我们已经在整个城市的要地
TYROL: We've stored arms and munitions

430
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,170
储备了武器与军需品
at key areas throughout the city.

431
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,420
我可以些提供迫击炮和火箭筒
MATHIAS: I can supplement that with mortars, RPGs,

432
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,930
和猛禽机上的一些肩扛式防空导弹
even a few shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft missiles aboard the Raptor.

433
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,010
很好
Great.

434
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,470
当信号发出时  我们的人就开始攻击机场  
So, when we give the signal, our people are gonna attack the airbase,

435
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,720
拘留中心 电站  
the detention center, the power station,

436
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,100
还有其他关键设施
and other critical facilities.

437
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,600
这个计划就是要在卡拉狄加与帕伽索斯到达时
The plan is to sow as much chaos and confusion as possible

438
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,560
尽可能制造混乱
the moment Galactica and Pegasus arrive.

439
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,690
那能够帮助掩护撤退
That should help cover the evacuation.

440
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,650
不会有帕伽索斯  只有卡拉狄加
No Pegasus. Just Galactica.

441
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,780
为什么?为什么没有帕伽索斯?发生了什么?
Why? Why no Pegasus? What happened?

442
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,980
不知道  长官  
I don't know, sir.

443
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,780
那已超出了我的职务范围
Way beyond my pay grade.

444
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,700
你们的撤退计划是什么?
What about your evac plan?

445
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,030
我们已经任命与分配了500名队长
We've designated and assigned 500 block captains

446
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,410
覆盖在城市的每一个角落
to cover each sector of the city.

447
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,790
每一个分队长均负责集中 
Each block captain is responsible

448
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,200
并引导他(她)负责区域内的人们
for rallying and guiding the people

449
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,080
乘坐指定飞船按即定路线撤离
in his or her sector along their escape route to their designated ship.

450
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,040
你们不会已经演习过了吧?
I don't suppose you've been able to rehearse any of this?

451
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,670
是的  我们已经进行过3次模拟演习
Indeed. We've had three full dress rehearsals

452
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,340
在各类情况下
under the guise of fire and natural disaster drills.

453
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,800
但实际操作时  一定会有很多不同
MATHIAS: It'll be different when the balloon goes up.

454
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,220
爆炸  枪击  混乱  一定会出现很多恐慌
Explosions, shooting, chaos, there's gonna be some panic out there.

455
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,640
他们能做好的  这些人都知道重点
ROSLIN: They'll do fine. These people know that at some point,

456
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,970
他们有责任拯救他们自己
they're gonna have to be responsible for saving themselves.

457
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,350
我们所要做的就是做好准备  并祈祷一切顺利
All we need to do is be ready and hope for the best.

458
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,400
玛雅和伊西斯怎样了?
What about Maya and Isis?

459
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,520
我会处理的
I'm on it.

460
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,690
我会派两个最好的射手到那里
I've got my two best shooters here,

461
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,780
给他们作警卫
they're gonna be their escorts

462
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,650
确保他们能回到船上
and make sure they get back to the ship.

463
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,660
先生们  我无法告诉你们为什么
Gentlemen, I can't tell you why, but it is imperative

464
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,410
但让这个女人和她的小孩离开这颗星球十分要紧
that this woman and her child get off this planet.

465
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
我相信你  因为我信任他
I trust you because I trust him.

466
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,170
是 女士
Yes, ma'am.

467
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,920
少
Saul!

468
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,670
我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

469
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,520
烤面包机!
RESIDENT: Toaster.

470
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,610
她出卖了我们
SAM: She sold us out.

471
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,950
你到底在说些什么?    那是谎话
What are you talking about? That's a lie.

472
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,240
我们在汇合点遭到埋伏
We were ambushed at the rendezvous.

473
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,120
赛昂人确切知道我们所在的位置
The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.

474
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,790
不可能是艾伦     我什么也没干
Well, that doesn't mean Ellen... I didn't do anything!

475
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,460
这是那张地图  上校!  我画给你的那张  
This is the map, Colonel! The map that I drew for you.

476
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,500
在你帐篷里给你的那张
I gave this to you in your tent.

477
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,130
你本应该烧掉它 但你的老婆出现了  帮你做了这事
You were gonna burn it, but then your wife offered to do it for you.

478
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,800
我从一个死去的人形赛昂伏兵身上得到的
I got it off a dead skin job at the ambush.

479
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,210
完全一样
Do the math!

480
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,550
我想解释  少
I want to explain, Saul...

481
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,720
该死的叛徒!  闭上你的臭嘴
Gods-damn traitor... Shut your frakking mouth!

482
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,520
他说...
He said...

483
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
他说他会杀了你的 谁说的!
He said he'd kill you. Who said it?

484
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,480
其中一个卡维尔
One of the Brother Cavils.

485
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,240
我是为了你才做的  少
I did it for you, Saul.

486
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,070
全是为了你  我不得不做
It was all for you, I had to.

487
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,280
我别无选择
I didn't have any choice.

488
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,280
你难道看不出来吗?
Don't you see that?

489
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,300
378号抽屉
Drawer 378.

490
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,520
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

491
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,480
噢  天呀  是你
Oh, my God, it's you.

492
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,900
你背叛了你的人民
You're betraying your own people.

493
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,990
为了什么?
For what?

494
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,820
我现在是殖民地军官了
I'm a Colonial Officer now.

495
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,740
你不是他们的一员
You're not one of them.

496
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,120
我向他们保证过
I gave them my word.

497
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,700
那承诺没有价值
Now that's not what counts.

498
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,210
对于那些人
It's who you give it to.

499
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,120
我现在必须要杀了你
I'm gonna have to shoot you now.

500
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,000
赫拉还活着
Hera lives.

501
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,550
什么?
What?

502
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,010
你的女儿赫拉还活着
Your daughter Hera is alive.

503
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,470
你的新朋友没告诉你?
Didn't your friends tell you that?

504
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,770
他们骗你说她死了  他们把她藏了起来
They faked her death and they hid her from you.

505
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,280
随你怎么说
You would say anything.

506
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,820
不 我有过梦
No, I had dreams.

507
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,450
奇怪的梦
I had strange dreams.

508
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:11,280
我也有过奇怪的梦让我质疑我的信念
I was having strange dreams that made me question my faith,

509
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,450
让我质疑上帝
made me question God.

510
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,080
在那些梦里  有一个人类先知
And in the dreams there was a human oracle,

511
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,420
于是我去见了Dodona Selloi
so I went to see Dodona Selloi.

512
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,670
我不会杀你的
I'm not gonna kill you,

513
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,960
但我会打伤你  让你无法通知其他人
but I'm gonna wound you so you can't warn the others.

514
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,630
那个先知说 两个人的(爱情)之果
The oracle said that the fruit born of two peoples

515
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,380
还活在世上
is still alive,

516
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,640
就是赫拉还活着 而且如果我亲手抱起她
that Hera lives and I would hold her in my arms

517
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,970
我就能知道什么是真爱
and I would know true love.

518
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,480
把枪放下
Put down the gun

519
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,850
在我找到她时  你也可以抱着她
and when I find her, you can hold her, too.

520
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,370
阿达玛不会骗我的
Adama wouldn't lie to me.

521
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,540
你错了 你错了!
You're wrong. You're wrong!

522
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,140
启动钥匙看起来并没有被毁
The launch keys don't seem to have been damaged.

523
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,550
从数据点上得知
And from all the data points,

524
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,100
看来所有船都还有足够的燃料
it looks like the ships all still have enough tylium

525
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,600
至少能让他们跳跃一次
to make at least one jump.

526
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,270
顺便恭喜你
Congratulations, by the way.

527
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,060
我听说是个男孩
I heard it's a boy.

528
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,110
噢  他叫什么?
What's his name?

529
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,940
尼古拉斯  以凯莉祖父名字命名
Nicholas, after Cally's grandfather.

530
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,490
嘿  军士长
Hey, Chief,

531
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,070
你记得帮西洛撒赫拉的骨灰的时候吗?
you know when you helped Helo spread Hera's ashes?

532
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,580
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

533
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,240
你真的见到骨灰了吗?
You actually saw the ashes?

534
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,790
当然  怎么了?
Yeah, of course. Why?

535
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,960
没什么
Nothing.

536
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,840
记得告诉凯莉  千万别让她的孩子离开她的视线
Just make sure Cally never lets her kid out of her sight.

537
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:15,990
长官 刚跳跃回来的猛禽机带回的消息
Sir, the listening Raptor just jumped back.

538
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,830
莎伦拿到了启动钥匙
Sharon's got the launch keys.

539
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,270
形势推演室  我是赛道
Rec room, Racetrack.

540
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,610
非常好  长官
Very well, sir.

541
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,530
出发了
It's on.

542
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,230
我是上将
This is the Admiral.

543
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,940
你们都听说了
