1
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,020
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》 前情提要
ADAMA: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,240
你不能在扮演上帝后  又对你创造的东西不负责任
You cannot play God then wash your hands of the things that you've created.

3
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,700
迟早  这一天终会来临
Sooner or later, the day comes

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,780
那时你将无法回避你所做过的事情
when you can't hide from the things that you've done anymore.

5
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,000
所有殖民地军事单位注意
"Attention all colonial units.

6
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,540
我们受到赛昂人袭击
"Cylon attack underway.

7
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,800
这不是演习
"This is no drill. "

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,630
我马上就过去
I'll be right there.

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,300
怎么会?为什么?
How? Why?

10
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,220
已经不再重要
It doesn't really matter now.

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,850
重要的是  此时此刻  
What does matter is that, as of this moment,

12
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,180
战争开始了
we are at war.

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,230
你满肚子都是怒火、仇恨
ADAMA: You're full of bile, hatred,

14
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,810
酒精
poison.

15
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,400
对于你在地面上发生的事  我很抱歉
And I'm sorry for what happened to you down there,

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,440
但我要管理整艘船
but I gotta run a ship.

17
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,240
我不能忍受一个独眼的醉鬼
The last thing I need

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,240
在这儿坐着  还散播不满
is a one-eyed drunk sowing discontent and disobedience.

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,830
把你的屁股挪回你的地方并且不要再离开
So you can get your ass back into your quarters and not leave

20
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,410
直到你表现得 像我在过去30年里认识的那个男人
until you're ready to act like the man that I've known for the past 30 years.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,250
那个人不会再存在了  比尔
That man doesn't exist anymore, Bill.

22
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,790
你也不会再见到我了
You won't be seeing me again.

23
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,490
不知道在宇宙里  是否有一个地方
Is there really any place left in the universe

24
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,780
能放置这样的一个名贵物品?
deserving of such a rare and distinguished item?

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,240
我在想把它放在卫生间里 正正地摆在厕所上面
I was thinking put it in the bathroom, right over the toilet.

26
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,870
非常好的决定
Excellent choice.

27
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,250
噢  我的天啊
Oh, my Gods.

28
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,340
噢  托瑞  过来看看  这个档案是比利
Tory, come look at this. This is the dossier

29
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,010
在我登上卡拉狄加的第一天给我准备的
that Billy prepared for me my first day aboard Galactica.

30
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,890
真不敢想象我刚才差点把它丢垃圾桶里了
I can't believe I was about to throw this out in the trash.

31
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,720
瓦尔基里号
TORY: The Valkyrie.

32
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,560
这是阿达玛指挥官在卡拉狄加号之前指挥的吗?
This was Adama's command before Galactica? Mmm-hmm.

33
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,770
看这里
Look at that.

34
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,020
今年是阿达玛上将
This year marks Admiral Adama's

35
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,320
在殖民地联邦舰队服役45周年纪念
45th anniversary in the Colonial Fleet.

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,950
实际上  他的入伍纪念日就在最近几天
In fact, his commissioning date's only a few days from now.

37
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,620
帮我拿着
Here.

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,670
我想举办一个庆祝仪式
I think I want to have a ceremony.

39
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,420
让我们给上将颁个勋章
Let's give the Admiral a medal

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,710
纪念他45年来的卓越贡献
for 45 years of devoted service.

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,420
这是个再好不过的日子啦
Couldn't have come at a better time.

42
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,510
让大家共同感受一下这种气氛吧
Give the people something to feel good about for a change.

43
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,190
我是副长 全舰进入一级戒备状态
HELO ON PA: This is the XO. Set Condition 1 throughout the ship.

44
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,980
重复 全舰进入一级戒备状态
I repeat, set condition one throughout the ship.

45
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,520
这不是演习 
This is not a drill.

46
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,650
有什么情况?      有三架突袭机
What's the problem? Three Raiders.

47
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,440
正在持续接近  方向145  定位33
CBDR, bearing 145, carom 33.

48
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,700
但这不是他们的标准编队方式
But this isn't their standard wedge formation.

49
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,320
我们的CAP编队在哪?
Where's the CAP?

50
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,910
星芭和凯特会在98秒内拦截  长官
Starbuck and Kat will intercept in 98 seconds, sir.

51
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,700
他们看起来像是在追击同时还在交火
It looks like a pursuit and there's been weapons exchange between them.

52
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,040
追击?        是的  长官
A pursuit? Yes, sir.

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,250
看上去是两架突袭机在追击另一架
We've got two Raiders chasing a third.

54
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,800
他们有没有向我们开火?
Have they fired on any of ours yet?

55
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,300
没有  长官
No, sir.

56
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,640
他妈的他们在干吗?
What the hell are they doing?

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,690
好啦 让我们过去凑凑热闹 先不用开火
All right, let's see if we can climb up their asses without drawing any fire.

58
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,690
追击的那两架看起来对逃的那架很专注呢
These two seem pretty preoccupied with the other one.

59
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,360
对赛昂人之间的追击有什么看法呢?
Got any idea why Cylons would be chasing Cylons?

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,230
不知道  不关心
Don't know, don't care.

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,650
要等靠近了再说
But wait till we close the gap.

62
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,030
我可不想等得超出我的忍耐程度
I don't wanna chase these frakking things any longer than I have to.

63
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,160
是  收到
Yeah, roger that.

64
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,080
干掉了两架!  还有一架在逃!        凯特  关注六点钟方向
KAT: Two down! One to go! STARBUCK: Kat, check six.

65
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,000
该死的  凯特  是右侧  这架准备朝卡拉狄加飞去
Damn, Kat, flank right. This guy's headed right for Galactica.

66
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,170
我会跟上的  长官!
I'm on it, Starbuck.

67
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,090
紧急求救 紧急求救 紧急求救
NOVACEK ON RADIO: Krypter! Krypter! Krypter!

68
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,130
我是大狗
This is Bulldog.

69
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,220
快把我从这里救出去 我受伤了!
Get me the hell out of here. I'm wounded!

70
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,850
这是什么该死的东西?      目标进入射程 快包围
STARBUCK: What the frak is that? KAT: Target in range, closing in.

71
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,440
紧急求救  紧急求救  紧急求救  我是大狗
NOVACEK: Krypter! Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog...

72
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,850
音频自动追踪开启
KELLY: Audio lock-on enabled.

73
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,770
那东西是从哪来的?
Where is that coming from?

74
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,610
那是架突袭机  长官
GAETA: It's the Raider, sir.

75
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,570
紧急求救        快开火  凯特
NOVACEK: Krypter... STARBUCK: Take the frakking shot, Kat.

76
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,360
等下 我快和他联系上了
KAT: Gimme one sec, I almost got him lined up.

77
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,030
紧急求救 紧急求救 紧急求救
NOVACEK: Krypter! Krypter! Krypter!

78
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,410
我是大狗
This is Bulldog.

79
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,620
凯特  赶快射击!
STARBUCK: Kat, take the frakking shot.

80
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,830
命令蝮蛇战机停止射击
Order the Vipers to hold their fire immediately.

81
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,290
马上保护这架突袭机入舱
Have them escort the Raider in.

82
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,800
准备好监狱
Prisoner drill.

83
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,800
在飞行甲板设置警卫 5分钟内办完
I want the alert guard in the hangar deck in five minutes.

84
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,090
是  长官
Yes, sir.

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,600
好了  把那只"小鸟"停好!  让我们看看这架突袭机!
All right, park that bird! Let's grab this Raider!

86
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,520
大伙跟我上! 快点跟上来!
Let's go, people, move with a purpose!

87
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,940
给陆战队腾地方
Make some room for the Marines.

88
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,670
真的是你吗  长官?
Is it really you, sir?

89
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,980
是的
Yeah,

90
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,900
是我
it's me.

91
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,200
欢迎回家  大狗
Welcome home, Bulldog.

92
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,590
我们不会再有第二次机会了
We may never have this opportunity again.

93
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,840
我猜如果发现赛昂人的问题后  
I'm assuming you appreciate the consequences

94
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,340
你会感激这个决定的
if you're discovered.

95
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,930
并且你也该知道  指挥官
And you understand, Commander,

96
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,640
我们刚才的谈话是没有发生过的
that this conversation did not happen.

97
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,020
你想好了吗?
Are you prepared for this?

98
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,350
当然  长官
Of course, sir.

99
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,520
但有一个条件:
On one condition.

100
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,860
我要用我自己的人
I need my men.

101
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,650
尤其是要驾驶这艘秘密行动飞船的
Especially for the stealth ship.

102
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,990
只有一个飞行员是我能信任的
There's only one pilot I trust.

103
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,200
谁?
Who?

104
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,750
很好
Well,

105
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,880
持阴谋论者会大失所望的
the conspiracy theorists are gonna be disappointed.

106
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,090
我们已检查过你的DNA序列  与你在军队的纪录对比  
We've checked your DNA signature against your military records,

107
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,590
结果是很明确的
and it's conclusive.

108
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,970
你不是赛昂人
You're not a Cylon.

109
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,640
抽烟吗?
Smoke?

110
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,900
没错
That's right.

111
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,230
他是我的人
He's one of mine.

112
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,270
三年前失踪的
Disappeared about three years ago.

113
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,900
我们以为他被抓了
We think that he was captured.

114
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,070
我想见见他
I'd like to meet him.

115
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,450
当然可以 我会安排的
Of course. I'll arrange it.

116
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,750
他的检查没有问题
He checks out fine.

117
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,080
不管他们对他做过些什么
Whatever they did to him out there,

118
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,800
他们还是保证了他相对的健康程度
they kept him fed and relatively healthy.

119
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,670
总之  身体是健康的
Physically, anyway.

120
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,110
我知道你遭受了很多磨难
I know you've been through a lot.

121
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,780
我承认
I realize that.

122
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,440
但你必须告诉我  丹尼尔
But you've gotta talk to me, Danny.

123
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,120
你究竟是如何
How the hell did you escape

124
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,160
从赛昂人的基地之星逃出来的?
off a Cylon baseship?

125
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,960
好吧  长官  
Well, sir,

126
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,630
是这样的
it's like this.

127
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,130
敌人将我在监狱里囚禁了三年
The enemy had me locked in a cell for three years.

128
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,850
住宿条件很恶劣
The accommodations were lousy,

129
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,010
食物供给都跟不上了
the service was slow,

130
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,600
当我感觉到他们不再打算向我供给任何东西时
and after a while I felt the institution no longer had anything to offer me.

131
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,060
我就离开了
So I left.

132
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,820
你让我担心了好长一段时间
You had me worried there for a moment.

133
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,660
也想到  也许赛昂人被你的那种态度打败了
Thought maybe the Cylons had beaten the bullshit attitude out of you.

134
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,500
你是怎么出来的?
How'd you get out?

135
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,260
我以为我会死在那里  比尔
I thought I was gonna die in there, Bill.

136
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,510
但是不久前  他们突然都得病了
But a while ago, they all started getting sick.

137
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,390
我意思是真的病得很重
I mean really sick.

138
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,390
你是说有病毒?
You mean a virus?

139
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,360
是的
Yeah.

140
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,230
我们也知道
We've seen that, too.

141
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,860
我听到他们说病毒在扩散 情况在变糟…
I heard them say it was spreading, getting worse,

142
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,320
但是同时我也认识到
but eventually I realize,

143
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,870
我是不会被感染的
I'm not catching it.

144
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,120
我对它是免疫的
I'm immune.

145
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,710
那后来呢?
So what did you do?

146
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,710
我很聪明
I was smart,

147
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,880
很有耐心
patient.

148
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,250
我等待
I waited.

149
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,260
啊  很好呀
D'ANNA: Well, well.

150
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,680
你看起来不错
You're looking good.

151
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,220
强壮
Strong.

152
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,390
我...我已经感觉好些了
Me, I've felt better.

153
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,230
我不知道你这家伙为什么要锻炼身体
I don't know why you guys do all that exercise.

154
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,360
为什么呢  你在为了预防衰老?
What, are you trying to stave off getting old?

155
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,240
没看到我有多悲惨吗?
Doesn't seem such a tragedy to me,

156
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,910
给你个机会选择
given the alternatives.

157
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,370
你知道我说什么吗?
You know what I'm saying?

158
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,210
我看起来那么坏吗?
Do I look that bad?

159
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,300
你知道我在想什么吗?
You know what I think?

160
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,340
我想你在害怕
I think you're afraid.

161
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,860
让我来猜猜在你身上到底发生了什么
Let me try and understand exactly what happened to you.

162
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,690
我只准备回忆一小段  
I'm just gonna go back a little,

163
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,780
如何?
all right?

164
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,780
在赛昂人攻击殖民地联邦的一年前
About a year prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies,

165
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,620
你正在执行阿达玛上将的一项任务 对吗?
you were on a mission with Admiral Adama. Is that correct?

166
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,960
那是个秘密任务
It was a black ops mission.

167
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,050
嗯
Hmm.

168
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,930
你记得那些陶伦殖民地的人经常干些不法的事情
You remember the Tauron colonists were such outlaws,

169
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,100
还经常与舰队玩捉迷藏 以此得到他们想要的?  
always pushing their luck with the Admiralty every chance they got?

170
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,930
对
ROSLIN: Right.

171
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,360
陶伦人在一个卫星上开采泰里恩矿
The Taurons were drilling for tylium ore

172
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,230
那颗卫星离赛昂人的停火线很近
on a moon that was too close to the Cylon armistice line.

173
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,490
我们觉得必须让他们从那里离开
We knew that they had to get out of there

174
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,910
否则就会激怒赛昂人
or risk provoking the Cylons.

175
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,380
对不起  但这个事情与他的飞船被击落有什么关系?
I'm sorry, but how did this result in his ship being shot down?

176
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,130
他是我的侦查机飞行员
He was my recon pilot.

177
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,210
他去那里收集证据
He was there to gather evidence.

178
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,010
陶伦人一定是看到我们来了 因为他们围攻他
The Taurons must have seen us coming, because they ambushed him.

179
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,680
那维克中尉
Lieutenant Novacek was shot down

180
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,010
被陶伦人冷血地击落
by the Taurons in cold blood.

181
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,930
紧急求救  紧急求救  紧急求救  我左舷引擎损坏
NOVACEK: Krypter! Krypter! Krypter! I've got damage to the port engine.

182
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,810
正在坠落  重复
Bird is down. Repeat,

183
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,730
正在坠落 请求救助
bird is down. Request rescue.

184
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,730
秘密之星传来的信息       我是大狗
MAN: Stealthstar transmission acquired. NOVACEK: This is Bulldog,

185
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,070
我在坠落 重复
bird is down. Repeat,

186
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,740
我在坠落 请求救助
bird is down. Request rescue.

187
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,700
那你当时做了什么?
So what did you do?

188
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,290
我判断错误
I made a bad call.

189
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,880
以为船已坠毁
His ship was gone.

190
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,050
雷达没有弹射座椅信号
No ejection on dradis.

191
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,130
也没有求救信号
No distress call.

192
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,800
以为他已经死了
He was dead,

193
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,970
然后我们就离开了
so I left.

194
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,230
但很明显  中尉的座椅弹射出来了 并且还幸免遇难
But the lieutenant did eject, obviously, and somehow survived

195
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,770
在他的弹射座椅中待了足够长的时间
in his ejection seat long enough

196
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,230
这还让赛昂人找到他了
for the Cylons to find him.

197
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,650
哇
Wow.

198
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,400
你们能让我考虑一下吗?
Could you both give us a moment, please?

199
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,740
谢谢你  托瑞  非常谢谢你  中尉
Thank you, Tory, and thank you very much, Lieutenant,

200
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
我很感谢 总统女士
I appreciate it. Madam President.

201
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,080
让我们查查舰队的登记名册
Why don't we check the fleet registry,

202
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,500
看看你是否还有家人生还  好吗?
see if any of your family might have survived?

203
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,520
好的 现在你能告诉我到底发生了什么吗?
So, are you gonna tell me what really happened?

204
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,190
这个事情你一定要相信我  好吗?
You're gonna have to trust me on this one, okay?

205
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,530
这是我捅出的娄子
It's my mess.

206
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,610
我会弥补的
I'll fix it.

207
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,180
好吧 这是最后一次    对
Okay, this is the last one. Yeah.

208
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,850
开火
Fire.

209
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,420
我知道了
TIGH: I see it.

210
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,100
我知道了
I see it.

211
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,770
我知道了
I see it.

212
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,690
我知道了
I see it.

213
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,900
丹尼尔 那维克刚逃出来了
Daniel Novacek

214
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,910
从赛昂人的一艘基地之星的监狱里逃出来了
just escaped from a POW cell on a Cylon baseship,

215
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,330
偷了一架突袭机  飞回来了
stole a Raider, flew it here.

216
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,410
我刚才给他做个终结报告
I just finished debriefing him.

217
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,210
大狗还活着?
Bulldog's alive?

218
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,790
是啊
Yeah.

219
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,040
我的天
My Gods.

220
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,760
他是怎么活下来的?
How could he be alive?

221
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,930
那个坚强的臭小子 他最后成功了 是不是?
That tough son of a bitch, he actually made it, didn't he?

222
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,300
是的  我猜他是成功了
Yeah, I guess he did.

223
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:26,100
那你过来是跟你的朋友说 还是跟你的副长说?
So, are you here to talk to your friend or to your XO?

224
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,940
我想这次  都不是
And last time I checked, I was neither.

225
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,030
我懂了
Oh... I get it.

226
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,780
噢  是啊
Oh, yeah.

227
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:45,080
这对你有一点点复杂  对吗  上将?
This is gonna be a little complicated for you, isn't it, Admiral?

228
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,830
你要告诉他  你做了什么?
You gonna tell him what you did?

229
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,580
我做了我必须该做的
I did what I had to do.

230
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,920
那就告诉他
So tell him.

231
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,460
但这并不改变任何结果 过去的事情就过去了
It's not gonna make any difference. The past is the past.

232
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,340
你支支吾吾的
You're equivocating.

233
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,470
我不知道我来这该死的地方干嘛  告诉他!
I don't know why the frak I came here. Tell him!

234
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,680
他会知道的
He's gonna find out

235
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,550
迟早的事
sooner or later.

236
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,070
我知道了
I see it.

237
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,640
走开
Go away.

238
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,400
他妈的该死的家伙
Gods damn son of a bitch.

239
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,210
我真不敢想象
I can't believe it.

240
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,170
真的是你
It's really you.

241
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,500
丹尼尔 那维克
Danny Novacek.

242
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,170
他们告诉我你成功逃了出来
I heard you'd made it.

243
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
干得好  大狗
Good for you, Bulldog.

244
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,340
哦 天啊
Oh, Gods.

245
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,640
少
Saul.

246
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,600
来点酒?
A drink?

247
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,520
这主意不错
You have no idea.

248
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,190
是啊  确实不错
Yes, I do.

249
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,700
爸爸?
Dad?

250
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,250
嘿  我刚接到你的通知
Hey, I just got your message.

251
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,000
谢谢你过来
Thank you for coming.

252
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,370
坐下
Sit down.

253
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,540
该是我们聊聊的时候了
It's time for us to talk.

254
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,140
我问你几个问题
Let me ask you something.

255
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,430
你经常来卡拉狄加吗?
How often you get out of here?

256
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,180
为什么这么问   一直在这啊
Why? All the time.

257
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,310
我正在经历着一些麻烦 就这样
I've been a little under the weather, that's all.

258
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,900
那你是一直待在这个老水桶里来着?
And how'd you wind up on this old bucket anyway?

259
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,690
瓦尔基里号怎么了?
What happened to the Valkyrie?

260
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,820
好吧  嗯  那我们就说说
Well, let's just say

261
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,860
那次任务对老头子职业生涯来说 并不是什么好事
that last mission wasn't exactly a boon to the old man's career.

262
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,490
卡拉狄加就是他最后光荣的退役
Galactica was his graceful retirement.

263
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,500
听说你和老头子好长时间不说话了
Heard you and the old man haven't spoken in a while.

264
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,210
怎么了?
What's wrong?

265
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,790
他不再像过去那样跟你穿一条裤子了吧?
He won't cover your ass day and night like he used to?

266
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,630
噢  不  他还在跟我穿一条裤子呢
Oh, no, he still does his share of ass-covering.

267
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,090
问题是  那是他应该的
Problem is, it's his main function now.

268
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,720
当然了  
Of course,

269
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,470
考虑到你在那里受伤并被抓
considering how you wound up getting captured in the first place,

270
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,310
我猜你自己想离开的话并不太容易  对吧?
I guess you found that out the hard way yourself, didn't you?

271
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,650
你想说什么?
What's that supposed to mean?

272
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,480
我的天
My Gods.

273
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,030
他没有告诉你  是不是？
He didn't tell you, did he?

274
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,870
是不是?
Did he?

275
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,490
跟我说什么?
Tell me what?

276
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,620
那个狗娘养的
That son of a bitch.

277
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,210
是我把他射下来的
I shot him down.

278
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,970
那好  如果是你射下的他  那你一定有你的理由
Well, if you shot him down, you had your reasons.

279
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,100
你在执行命令
You were following orders,

280
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,810
担心更糟糕的事情发生  对吗?
preventing something worse, right?

281
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,890
不是
No.

282
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,980
我把他射下来是为了防止...
I shot him down to avoid

283
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,190
防止他被发现
detection.

284
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,030
确保任务保密
Protect the mission,

285
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,110
那他就不会被赛昂人发现
so it wouldn't be discovered by the Cylons.

286
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,790
那是个秘密任务
It was a black ops mission

287
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,630
目的是...
whose sole purpose

288
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,130
是确认赛昂人攻击的可能性
was to ascertain the likelihood of a Cylon strike.

289
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,390
赛昂人的攻击?
"Cylon strike"?

290
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,520
那你是在说...
So, you're saying that...

291
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,780
我们在过去就知道它们准备攻击了
That we knew they were out there?

292
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,990
它们可能准备发动针对殖民地联邦的攻击?
That they could launch an attack on the Colonies?

293
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,660
我们没有确切的信息
We didn't know anything for sure.

294
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,540
有些人是这样认为的
There were theories in some circles

295
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,460
赛昂人隐匿那么久的原因
that the reason that the Cylons had stayed dormant for so long

296
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,010
是因为他们在建造战争机器
was because they were building a war machine,

297
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,050
在准备攻击我们
preparing a strike.

298
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,640
但我认为...
But I thought...

299
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,810
没人见到或听说赛昂人了 将近40年了
I thought that no one had seen or heard from the Cylons in over 40 years.

300
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,690
那是对的 相对的
That's true, partially.

301
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,610
阿达尔政权领导下的军部对此深感不安
The Admiralty had grown restless with the Adar administration.

302
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,610
他们认为我们现在在吃老本
They thought we were resting on our laurels,

303
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,080
没有准备好保护人们免于攻击
unprepared to protect against an attack.

304
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,540
我的任务是派遣一艘秘密侦察船
My mission was to escort a stealth recon ship

305
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,290
越过停火线
just beyond the armistice line.

306
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,420
仔细观察  收集证据
Stick our nose over, gather evidence,

307
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,670
看看他们有没有任何可疑的行动
see if there was any suspicious activities.

308
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,100
那如果赛昂人发现你们越过停火线
And if the Cylons discovered you had crossed the line,

309
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,350
违背停战协议  那他们可以把这种行为视为…
breaching the armistice, then they would see that as...

310
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,430
战争行为
An act of war.

311
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,320
秘密之星  这里是瓦尔基里号  我们在雷达上监测到
MAN: Stealthstar, Valkyrie. We register you on dradis,

312
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,980
你刚刚越过停火线
just past the armistice line.

313
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,360
你要提高警惕 谨慎行动
You're on full alert. Proceed with caution.

314
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,870
瓦尔基里号 我是大狗
Valkyrie, Bulldog.

315
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,530
我刚过了停火线两公里远
I'm exactly two clicks past the line.

316
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,620
重复 两公里远 并且我的雷达上
Repeat, two clicks and I've got

317
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,540
没有任何反应
negative dradis contacts.

318
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,500
没有东西 长官
Sir, there's nothing here, sir.

319
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,090
看来我运气不错
Which is fine by me.

320
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,710
公费旅行 你们找对机师了
Company wants to pay me for a joyride, they came to the right driver.

321
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,260
一颗很大的卫星
Hell of a moon.

322
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,640
雷达发现目标 有未知飞船跳跃过来
MAN: Dradis contact. Unknown vessel just jumped in.

323
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,930
妈的!
Frak!

324
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,020
紧急求救  我左舷引擎损坏
Krypter! Krypter! Krypter! I've got damage to the port engine.

325
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,650
正在坠落 重复  正在坠落
Bird is down. Repeat, bird is down.

326
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,980
请求救助
Request rescue.

327
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,860
紧急求救 我是大狗
Krypter! Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.

328
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,280
那艘飞船刚跳跃走  长官
MAN: Vessel just jumped out, sir.

329
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,160
我在坠落 请求救助
NOVACEK: Bird is down. Request rescue.

330
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,870
紧急求救 我是大狗
Krypter! Krypter! Krypter! This is Bulldog.

331
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,280
正在坠落 重复 
Bird is down! Repeat.

332
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,540
雷达发现另外两个目标 长官  请指示
MAN: Two more dradis contacts. Sir, please instruct.

333
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,460
您有什么命令  长官？
What are your orders, sir?

334
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,130
长官  您有什么命令?
Sir, what are your orders?

335
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,590
不要这么做
TIGH: Don't do this.

336
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,710
要考虑清楚  比尔  你不会这么干的
Think about it, Bill. You don't want to do this.

337
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,720
你想让他的船被发现吗?
Do you want his ship discovered?

338
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,840
你知道我们现在在哪吗?
Do you know where we are?

339
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:04,060
你知不知道这会有什么后果?
Do you have any idea what this could mean?

340
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,190
未知飞船正在拦截航线上
MAN: Bogies on intercept course.

341
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,270
将在20秒内抵达秘密之星
Will merge with Stealthstar in 20 seconds.

342
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,400
长官?
Sir?

343
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,980
武器
Weapons,

344
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,280
发射舰对舰导弹  马上!
launch ship-to-ship missile, now.

345
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,250
不!
No!

346
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,100
这不可能    噢  那就是事实
There is no way... Oh, it's true.

347
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,930
并且你也知道那是真的
And you know it's true.

348
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,020
在那以后  你每时每刻都知道
You've known it every second of every day since it happened.

349
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,270
并且你很快就会承认的
And the sooner you admit it,

350
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,110
很快你的眼神里也就不会再有疑惑
the sooner you might get that haunted look out of your eyes.

351
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,980
听我说
Listen to me.

352
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,570
在那个时候  如果你幸存下来 对大家反而意味着结束
Sometimes surviving can be its own death sentence.

353
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,990
我知道的
I know that.

354
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,720
那么攻击那维克飞船的...
So the attack on Novacek's ship,

355
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,810
那个击伤他座机的
the one that winged him

356
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,390
还有当时雷达上显示的两个信号
and the two dradis contacts that were following him,

357
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,270
他们不是陶伦星人 是赛昂人攻击的
they weren't Taurons. Those were the Cylons.

358
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,820
这些年来  我跟自己说
For all those years, I told myself

359
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,200
我不知道他们是谁
that I didn't know what they were.

360
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,660
我只能这样骗自己
But I was just lying to myself.

361
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,330
假装那不是真的
Pretending that it couldn't be true.

362
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,750
那是真的
It is true.

363
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,850
是我开启了战争
I started it.

364
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,020
是我引发的
Initiated it.

365
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,680
等会儿
Wait a minute.

366
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,600
你开启了什么?
You started what?

367
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,400
引发了什么?
Started what?

368
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,570
对殖民地联邦的进攻
The attacks on the Colonies.

369
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,490
因为我越过了停火线
By crossing the line,

370
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,370
我让它们以为...
I showed them that

371
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,700
我们是群好战分子  
we were the warmongers

372
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,580
就如它们所说的
they figured us to be.

373
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:38,960
并且我...
And I...

374
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,880
我让它们别无选择
I left them but one choice.

375
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,090
只有攻击我们
To attack us

376
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,510
在我们攻击它们前
before we attacked them.

377
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,720
不 不
No. No.

378
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,890
因为那不只是因为你
Because it wasn't just you.

379
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,060
是他们让你去那的
They put you there.

380
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,820
是他们让你去那越过停火线的 你没有选择的余地
They put you there, across the line. You had no choice.

381
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,570
那是军部的命令 那是...军队的命令
That was the Admiralty. That was the... That was the military.

382
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,780
你是在执行一个任务
You were one mission.

383
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,990
你只是一个人
You were one man.

384
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,870
一个人
One man.

385
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,160
只担当自己作为其中之一的责任
It only takes one.

386
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,810
你还好吗?
CAPRICA SIX: You're all right?

387
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,310
很好  当然
Yeah, of course.

388
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
做了更多的噩梦?
More nightmares?

389
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,900
梦
Dreams.

390
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,650
尽管这次有点不同
Something different this time, though.

391
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,910
我想上帝准备告诉我一些事情
I think God's trying to tell me something.

392
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,290
是关于盖尤斯  是吗?     不
It's about Gaius, isn't it? No.

393
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,910
不是的
It's not.

394
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,670
是关于一些更重要的
It's about something much bigger than that.

395
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,800
在你执行这个命令后
After you execute this command,

396
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:12,140
你要从你的日志中删除这个命令
you'll delete the order from your logs

397
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,060
并覆盖相应的存储位置
then overwrite the corresponding memory locations.

398
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,280
执行
Execute.

399
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,180
没事了 没事了
BOOMER: It's okay. It's okay.

400
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,640
放松  试着呼吸
Relax, try to breathe through it.

401
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,230
呼吸
Breathe.

402
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,200
噢  在生死之间
This is something beautiful.

403
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,120
有很美丽的景象
Miraculous, between life and death.

404
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,720
嗯
Hmm.

405
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,390
真是不可思议
That's weird.

406
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,990
为什么他妈的他们一直没有击中?
Why the hell do they keep missing?

407
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,790
妈的
Frak.

408
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
阿达玛
Adama.

409
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,530
上将  那维克中尉给你电话
DUALLA: Admiral, you have a call from Lieutenant Novacek.

410
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,450
把他接过来    比尔吗?
Put him through. NOVACEK: Bill?

411
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,450
是的?        我是丹尼尔
Yes? This is Danny.

412
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,120
我们需要谈谈    等会
We need to talk. Hold on.

413
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,790
我想现在就见到你
I need to see you right now.

414
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,040
等会 我马上就会过去
Hold on. I'll be right there.

415
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,290
是赛昂人给他装备的
The Cylons are saddled up on him.

416
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,210
它们的射击很完美 没有偏一丁点
They've got a perfect point-blank, no-deflection shot.

417
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,760
它们应该能让他毙命的
They had him dead to rights.

418
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,130
我想是吧
I'd say so.

419
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,470
听着  那维克被击中了  还冒着烟  还能飞得很直很水平
Look, Novacek was hit and smoking, flying straight and level.

420
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,390
一块金属片就该能要了他的命
Any nugget could make that kill.

421
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,310
赛昂人不应该浪费那么多次机会的 但是他们没杀了他
The Cylons could've wasted him any number of times, and they didn't.

422
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,860
它们没杀他 它们让他跑了
They didn't. They let him escape.

423
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:17,200
赛昂人没有做什么是让人很意外
The Cylons don't do anything by accident.

424
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,120
没错  这就是我在想的
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too.

425
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,910
那维克有没有说他是怎样
Did Novacek say

426
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,790
从赛昂人监狱里跑出来的?
how he was able to overcome the Cylons that were holding him prisoner?

427
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,590
他们都生病?  中了病毒?
They were sick? Had a virus?

428
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,300
我的意思是  赛昂人中了多少种病毒  长官?
I mean, how many viruses do the Cylons have, sir?

429
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,340
谁知道呢? 可能是同一种病毒
Who knows? Maybe it was the same virus

430
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,680
就是我们发现的那些赛昂人得的
those Cylons we found were suffering from.

431
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,720
那好  也许他们只是在给我们编个故事  让我们上当呢
Yeah, or maybe they just told us a story that we'd buy.

432
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,310
一些我们很相信很熟悉的故事
Something that was credible, familiar.

433
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,900
那维克被基地之星关了三年
Novacek was held prisoner on a baseship for three years,

434
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,650
他逃出来了  并且很容易的找到了我们的舰队
escapes, and then conveniently finds our fleet

435
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,070
毫无根据的毫无理由的在这出现
with no agenda and no reason to be here.

436
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,950
嗨  丹尼尔
Hey, Dan.

437
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,040
平时训练的都报答给你了  这很有意思啊
NOVACEK: It's funny how all the training comes back.

438
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,380
对吧?
Huh?

439
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,560
为什么要骗我  比尔?
Why did you lie to me, Bill?

440
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,910
这些年来...
All those years,

441
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,320
你知道我是怎么跟自己说的吗?
you know what I kept telling myself?

442
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:46,160
那是我做的多么愚蠢  多么该死的梦?
What stupid, frakked-up dream I held onto?

443
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,620
我一直在想
I kept thinking,

444
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,580
"只要挺下来  大狗"
"Just hang in there, Bulldog.

445
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,880
"比尔・阿达玛快来了"
"Bill Adama's coming.

446
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,166
"他不会让你困在这里的  那不是他 
"He won't leave you to rot in here, not him.

447
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:56,760
他是不会让任何人落下的"
 He won't leave a man behind.

448
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,260
"只要坚持住"  但你没来救我
"Just hold on. " But you weren't coming.

449
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,310
你没想过我还活着 你都没有期望过我能活下来!
You didn't think I was alive. You weren't even hoping I was alive!

450
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,680
如果我没找到逃出去的方法
And if I hadn't figured a way to escape,

451
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:13,610
如果我在看到它们没把门关上的时候 没采取行动
if I didn't make my move when I saw they left that door wide open for me,

452
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,900
我现在肯定已经是条尸体!
I'd be as good as dead right now!

453
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,620
是它们留的吗?
Is that what they did?

454
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,370
是它们让门敞开着?
Did they leave the door standing open?

455
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,990
是它们让你逃出来的?
Did they let you escape?

456
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,290
那不是我说的意思
That's not what I meant.

457
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,660
我知道发生了什么
I know the truth.

458
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,540
是我打败了他们  你懂吗?
I beat them. Do you understand?

459
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,460
我在和它们的周旋中打败了它们
I beat them at their own game.

460
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:40,090
我杀死了该死的她  然后逃了出来
I frakking killed her, and I escaped.

461
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,510
你不承认我是自己逃出来的?!
You trying to take that away from me?

462
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,140
大狗!
TIGH: Bulldog!

463
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,610
蹲着!
Stay down!

464
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,240
你还好吗  比尔?
Are you all right, Bill?

465
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,650
是的  我还好
Yeah, I'm okay.

466
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,780
你不想承认  是吗?   我知道
You don't wanna believe it, do you? I know.

467
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,580
现实很难接受  大狗
The truth hurts, Bulldog,

468
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,790
但是活在真相里要比活在谎言里更好
but it's better to know the truth than to live a lie.

469
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,500
我们都是士兵  丹尼尔
We're all soldiers, Danny.

470
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,170
我们都要面对牺牲的
We're all expendable.

471
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,040
并且我们做了不得不做的事情 来保护任务的机密性
And we did what we had to do to protect the mission.

472
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,840
这很不好听  但事实如此  但赛昂人放了你出来
It's ugly, but there it is. The Cylons let you go.

473
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,800
这是为什么呢?  你自己扪心自问  丹尼尔
The question is, why? Ask yourself that, Danny.

474
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,390
因为在一分钟以前
Because up until a minute ago,

475
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,140
你就在做它们想让你做的事
you were doing exactly what they wanted you to do.

476
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,230
来到这里知道真相并寻仇
Come here and learn the truth and seek revenge.

477
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,770
并且那就是你正在做的事
And that's exactly what you did.

478
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,110
你差点就让它们的计划得逞了
You almost gave them what they wanted.

479
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,820
告诉你个不好的小秘密:
Tell you a dirty little secret.

480
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,450
一个人最难忍受的事
The toughest part of getting played

481
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,450
就是丧失你的尊严
is losing your dignity.

482
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,750
感觉就像是你喘气都没价值了 你会倒下来
Feeling like you are not worth the oxygen you are sucking down.

483
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,260
你会习惯的
You get used to it.

484
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,220
你会开始相信的
You start to believe it.

485
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,010
你会开始喜欢上的
You start to love it.

486
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,140
就像一瓶永远也喝不完的酒
It's like a bottle that never runs dry.

487
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:15,020
你可以伸手去拿很多很多很多次
You can keep reaching for it over and over and over again.

488
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,980
那你现在把酒瓶子丢了吗  少?
So, how do you put that bottle away, Saul?

489
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,110
我不知道
I don't know.

490
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,660
有一天你会决定...
One day, you just decide to

491
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,660
站起来走出自己的房间
get up and walk out of your room.

492
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,930
这是什么?
ROSLIN: What is this?

493
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,350
你的辞职书 你肯定是在和我开玩笑
Your resignation? You have gotta be kidding me.

494
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,110
我以前说过...
I've said before,

495
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,030
我们不能隐瞒自己所做过的事情
we can't hide from the things that we've done.

496
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,410
在这种情况下我别无选择
I see no other way around this situation.

497
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,530
也许是时候了  劳拉
Maybe it's time, Laura.

498
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,290
坐下  比尔
Sit down, Bill.

499
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,340
我认为你很天真
I think you're being naive.

500
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,130
天真?
"Naive"?

501
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,260
你有没有想过军部是故意让你
Did it ever occur to you that the Admiralty

502
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,890
去挑起一场他们谋划的战争?
may have set you up to provoke a war they wanted?

503
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,480
去想像那些我们不能理解的可怕的事情
It's naive to think that horrible things that we can't understand

504
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,060
有个简单的解释就是天真
have simple explanations.

505
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:46,690
因为简单的解释让我们感觉上是控制了实际并未控制的事情
Because simple explanations make us feel like we have control when we don't.

506
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,610
我们知道赛昂人为什么攻击我们
We know why the Cylons attacked us,

507
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,370
这肯定不是因为某一个原因就造成的    噢  我的天呐
and it wasn't any one thing. Oh, my Gods!

508
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,040
我们做过数以千计的事情  
We did a thousand things,

509
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,040
有好的也有不好的
good and bad,

510
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,130
在这40年的每一天里都有  是这些事情使我们最后被攻击
every day for 40 years to pave the way for those attacks.

511
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,920
那也该做点什么
Something has to be done.

512
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
你知道这是什么吗?
You know what that is?

513
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,940
荣誉勋章
Medal of distinction.

514
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,120
这是在我听说你要辞职以前就准备好的
This was before I heard about this resignation of yours.

515
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,530
所以...
So...

516
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,210
我更愿意进行这项活动
I'd like to propose this.

517
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,210
你看起来很固执 在为什么东西而赎罪
You seem hell-bent on paying some kind of penance

518
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:48,050
为了那些你自认为做过的事情
for whatever it is you think you've done.

519
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,220
所以不要辞职了 你何不走出这里
So instead of resigning, why don't you get up and walk out of here,

520
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,640
明晚在飞行甲板的这个典礼上来见我
meet me on the port hangar deck tomorrow evening for this ceremony,

521
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,140
并让我把勋章别在你的胸口?
and let me pin a frakking medal to your chest?

522
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,930
我做不到
I can't.

523
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,640
不是为了你
It's not for you.

524
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,480
是为了他们
It's for them.

525
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,400
站在那里  让你的舰队知道
Stand up there, acknowledge your fleet,

526
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,900
做他们所期望的
and give them what they need.

527
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,320
一个英雄
A hero.

528
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,870
这才是你的赎罪方式
That'll be your penance,

529
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,950
就算它能毁了你
even if it kills you.

530
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,920
我谨代表全体人员很荣幸地给你
ROSLIN: On behalf of everyone in this room, it is my pleasure to present you,

531
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,670
阿达玛上将
Admiral Adama,

532
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,010
颁发荣誉勋章
with the medal of distinction

533
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,720
以纪念你45年来英勇无畏的为殖民地联邦舰队效力
for your 45 years of courageous service to the Colonial Fleet.

534
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,020
祝贺你
Congratulations.

535
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:22,600
你一到那里就让苏菲医生打我电话
Have Dr. Stoffa call me as soon as you arrive.

536
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,230
还有  大狗  你会好起来的
And, Bulldog, you're gonna be fine.

537
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:28,110
只要记住还需要点时间   好
Just remember it'll take some time. All right.

538
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,400
中尉
Lieutenant,

539
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,740
你忘了些东西
you forgot something.

540
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,990
我办不到 比尔 我...      穿上它
I can't. Bill, I... Take it.

541
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,910
你别想那么容易就脱下它
You're not getting off that easy.

542
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,250
一日机师  终生机师  大狗
Once a pilot, always a pilot, Bulldog.

543
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,970
是  长官
Yes, sir.

544
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,960
请进
ADAMA: Come in.

545
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,350
我听说你得了个勋章
I heard you won a medal.

546
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,360
是的
Yeah.

547
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,150
他们这些天把所有东西都发下去了
They give them out for anything these days.

548
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,160
