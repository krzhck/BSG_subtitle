1
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,440
《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》 前情提要
STARBUCK: Previously on Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,940
我们还没正式介绍过 我是李奥本
We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Leoben.

3
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,650
我期待与你多待上一会呢  星芭
I'm looking forward to spending a little more time with you, Starbuck.

4
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,860
我们还有很多事要谈
We have a lot to talk about!

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,990
那将是很有趣的
It's gonna be fun.

6
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,950
恭喜你  指挥官
Congratulations, Commander.

7
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,160
帕伽索斯由你指挥
The Pegasus is your command.

8
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,210
我看到一个巨大的星体
SKULLS: Hey, I am picking up a large planetary body.

9
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,090
它是可居住的 我们也许找到了一个可供居住的星球
It's habitable. We may have just found a world that can support human life.

10
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,460
我清楚自己心中认为在那个行星定居 
ROSLIN: I know in my gut that settling on this planet's

11
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,340
对于人类来说意味着灾难
gonna mean disaster for humanity,

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,050
不然我也不想说我想赢得这次选举了
and I will not say otherwise just to win an election.

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,010
我接受科波十二个殖民地总统之职
I take the office of President of the 12 Colonies of Kobol.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,430
我将要发布我的第一个命令
And I am going to sign my first executive order

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,020
要求舰队立即建立殖民区定居点
requiring to immediately establish settlements

16
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,730
在我们现在的新卡布里卡星球上
on the planet we have come to know as New Caprica.

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,690
如果你想要下去  那就下去吧  请便
If you want to move down there, go ahead, be my guest.

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,070
到下面和男人们鬼混去吧
Go down and cat around with all the men.

19
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,940
少  我喜欢的人是你
Saul, I want you.

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,570
至少  一个安全的天堂  我们能把它称作家
CALLY: At last, a safe haven we can call home.

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,500
我的天
Oh, my Gods!

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,420
这是赛昂舰队  他们找到我们了
The Cylon fleet, they found us.

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,290
我们必须离开这里  长官
APOLLO: We have to get out of here, sir.

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,590
我们不能扔下我们的人
We can't just leave all those people behind.

25
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,710
我们什么也做不了
There's nothing we can do.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,710
我们不在战斗状态  长官
We're in no shape for a fight, sir.

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,090
他们会被消灭的
ADAMA: They'll be wiped out.

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,340
我们没有选择
We don't have a choice.

29
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,590
我们现在必须离开这里!
We need to get out of here right now!

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,760
开始跳跃准备  我们要离开了
Begin jump prep. We're leaving.

31
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,350
但是我们会回来的
But we'll be back.

32
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,100
赛昂人刚刚跳跃到轨道上
The Cylons just jumped into orbit.

33
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,060
并且舰队跳跃走了 他们已经离开我们了
And the fleet's jumped away. They've left us.

34
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,900
我代表12殖民地的人民...
BALTAR: On behalf of the people of the 12 Colonies,

35
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,690
投降
I surrender.

36
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,700
我正在找卡拉・瑟瑞丝
I'm looking for Kara Thrace.

37
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,560
每次他们把你带出这间拘禁室
Do you know that every time they take you out of this cell,

38
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,480
我们就来这里改变那些细微的
we come in here and we change those little hashmarks

39
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,980
你隐藏在日期里的标记
on your little calendar there you're trying to hide?

40
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,780
马铃薯  肉汤  甚至还有一些胡萝卜
Potatoes, gravy, even some carrots.

41
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,020
老天  我们感谢你满桌子的慷慨
Heavenly Father, we thank you for the bounty of this table.

42
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,270
爽  
ELLEN: Yes.

43
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,810
好爽
Yes.

44
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,690
来吧!别停下
Come on, don't stop.

45
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,240
来吧!来吧! 狗娘养的!
Come on, come on, you son of a bitch!

46
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,450
狗娘养的!
You son of a bitch!

47
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,120
好的!
Oh, yeah.

48
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,760
啊  宝贝  啊!
Oh, boy.

49
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,140
好!我们装备好了
All right, we're armed.

50
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,310
他们回航了  我们行动吧!
They're inbound. Let's move!

51
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,170
我需要一把刀
I need a knife.

52
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,190
谢谢
Thank you.

53
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,360
别客气
You're welcome.

54
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,290
我必须说  我很喜欢这样
I must say, I quite enjoyed that.

55
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,590
我很高兴
I'm so glad.

56
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,800
还有  我何时能够得到我想要的东西?
And when do I get what I want?

57
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,930
我相信现在就可以了
I believe that's happening right now.

58
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,320
我们今天重新审查了你的案件
We reviewed your case today,

59
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,410
我不得不说重审委员会对此很失望
and I must say there was great disappointment on the review committee.

60
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,770
来吧
Come on.

61
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,110
我们会按程序处理  这可能会花上一个小时
We've got to get you processed. It'll take an hour or so.

62
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,570
官僚主义就是这样子的
Bureaucracy must be served.

63
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,660
但是如果你运气好的话 你可以在晚饭时间回家
But if you're lucky, you'll get home by dinnertime.

64
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,030
上校 来吧
Colonel, come on.

65
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,370
我不会一直把这扇门开着的
I'm not gonna hold this door open forever.

66
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,180
注意 新卡布里卡市民们 很快 饮水将…
MAN ON PA: Attention, New Capricans. Effective immediately, a pot of water

67
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,930
在双数日期提供给双数编号的市民
will be given to residents in even-numbered pods on even-numbered days

68
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,310
在单数日期提供给单数编号的市民 供给量为…
and odd-numbered pods on odd-numbered days. Rationing will be...

69
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,480
少!
Saul!

70
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,990
亲爱的 他们都对你做了什么?
Oh, sweetheart. What did they do to you?

71
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,160
没事了  我出来了 就是这样了
It's all right. I'm out, and that's all that matters.

72
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,340
我们离开这里
Come on, now, let's get out of here.

73
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,500
好的
Okay.

74
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,560
好  准备好了吗?  就是现在
Okay, ready? Now!

75
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,110
他妈的怎么回事?  快  快!
Oh, for frak sakes. Come on! Come on!

76
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,990
这有用吗?
Is that thing gonna work or what?

77
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,710
起爆正是时候  走  走!
It worked that time. Come on. Go, go!

78
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,340
他妈的起义者
Frakking insurgents.

79
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,700
你今晚看上去...如此可爱
You look so lovely tonight.

80
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,110
我不久就能再一次见到你了  卡拉
I'll see you soon, Kara.

81
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,570
不着急
Take your time.

82
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,910
赛昂人占领…
ROSLIN: "One hundred and thirty fourth day

83
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,040
新卡布里卡的第134天
"of the Cylon occupation of New Caprica.

84
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,250
今天是火星日
"Today is Mars Day.

85
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,920
似乎是祭典战神的日子
"Somehow it seems appropriate to honor the God of War

86
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,840
感觉每天都处在永不停息的战争中
"on a day when it feels like perpetual war

87
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,720
这是我们的现实
"is the only realistic prospect for us.

88
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,060
自从卡拉狄加四个月前离开以后 我们与失去了和它的联系
"We've had no contact with Galactica since it left four months ago.

89
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,640
但是我绝不相信  阿达玛已经抛弃了我们
"But I refuse to believe that Adama has abandoned us.

90
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,770
无论何时何地  只要有可能的话 
"Our insurgency has been striking back against the Cylons

91
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,480
我们将一直反抗赛昂人的占领
"whenever and wherever possible.

92
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,240
虽然这种攻击是微不足道的
"Although at times, these attacks seem like futile gestures,

93
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,570
但是我相信  这对于士气是至关重要的
"I believe that they are critical to morale,

94
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,370
这也是为了保持希望
"to maintaining some measure of hope.

95
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,000
但为了使这种反抗有更大的影响
"But in order for the insurgency to have a more meaningful impact,

96
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,670
我们需要攻击一个引人注目的目标
"we need to strike a high-profile target.

97
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,130
这不仅仅是为了杀死赛昂人 因为他们不会死
"It is simply not enough to kill Cylons, because they don't die.

98
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,760
他们可以复活 他们可以继续在我们中间行走
"They resurrect themselves, and they continue to walk among us.

99
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,930
这很恐怖
"It is horrifying.

100
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,190
赛昂占领当局继续完善对城市的控制
"The Cylon Occupation Authority continues to exert complete control

101
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,230
并且我们完全受他们的支配
"over the city, and we remain at their mercy.

102
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,980
盖尤斯・波塔尔总统领导下的殖民地政府
"The Colonial Government, under President Gaius Baltar,

103
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,320
只是个傀儡政权
"functions in name only. "

104
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,780
让我们回顾一下 为什么我们在这里?
Let's review why we're here, shall we?

105
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,870
我们应该给人民传播"上帝"的声音
We're supposed to bring the word of God to the people, right?

106
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,160
保护人类免遭天谴
To save humanity from damnation

107
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,210
把上帝的爱带给这些贫穷、愚昧的人们
by bringing the love of God to these poor benighted people.

108
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,170
我们在这里是因为大多数的赛昂人…
We're here because the majority of the Cylon

109
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,170
认为攻击人类是一个错误
felt that the slaughter of mankind had been a mistake.

110
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,340
我们来这里是为了寻求一个和平生存的方式
We're here to find a new way to live in peace,

111
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,880
因为上帝希望我们活下去
as God wants us to live.

112
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,680
到目前为止  这看上去是个不错的开端
And it's been a fun ride so far.

113
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,220
但是我想要澄清我们的目标
But I want to clarify our objectives.

114
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,640
如果我们带着上帝的箴言
If we're bringing the word of God,

115
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,930
那么
then it follows

116
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,770
我们就必须采取任何必要的方式
that we should employ any means necessary to do so.

117
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,140
竭尽所能  达到我们的目的
Any means. Yes.

118
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,270
恐惧才能产生信仰 就像我所理解的
Fear is a key article of faith, as I understand it.

119
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,230
或许是时候给人们的身心
So perhaps it's time to instill a little more fear

120
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,900
慢慢灌输一些恐惧了
into the people's hearts and minds.

121
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,450
让我们处死波塔尔
Let's execute Baltar.

122
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,160
什么? 什么?!
What, what?

123
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,160
这不会发生的
That's not gonna happen.

124
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,000
仅仅因为他是你最喜欢的玩具
Just because he's your favorite toy

125
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,920
所以就不允许我们在这里干涉更重大的事情
shouldn't be allowed to interfere with the larger issues here.

126
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,500
我想我已经与你们合作了
I think that I have cooperated...

127
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,340
盖尤斯和我是一体的
Gaius is with me.

128
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,260
任何想要挑战的人必须先要对付我
Anyone who wants to challenge that will have to deal with me.

129
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,550
好吧  没有关系
No, it doesn't matter.

130
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,970
如果我们一开始就杀了他 那会有效果的
If we'd killed him at the beginning, it might have worked.

131
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,890
但是现在  大多数人认为他是一个叛徒
But now most humans think of him as a traitor

132
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,350
或许正在翘首以盼他的死讯呢
and would actually cheer his death.

133
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,560
很好  很好  我们不杀波塔尔
Fine, fine. We don't kill Baltar.

134
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,690
我们围捕那些反叛者的领袖 然后公开处死他们
We round up the leaders of the insurgency, and we execute them publicly.

135
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,900
我们随机在街上围捕
We round up, at random, groups off the street,

136
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,780
然后公开处死他们
and we execute them publicly.

137
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,660
发个消息说刽子手来了
Send a message that the gloves are coming off.

138
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,370
叛乱现在停止了 要不然我们就开始减少人口数量
The insurgency stops now or else we start reducing the human population

139
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,290
让人数降到一个更有利于管理的水平
to a more manageable size.

140
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,750
我不知道是多少 少于1000人吧
I don't know, say less than 1,000.

141
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,290
我们不能再做屠夫了
We need to stop being butchers.

142
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,380
重点应放在这里 开始一种新生活
The entire point of coming here was to start a new way of life,

143
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,550
忘记过去我们和人类长久以来的冲突
to push past the conflict that separated us from humans for so long.

144
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,380
我们得到了什么?
CAVIL: And what has it gotten us?

145
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,010
这看上去不像是他们在欢迎我们...
It's not like they welcomed us with...

146
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,140
妈的别介意 你们都生活在一个幻想的世界中
Oh, frak it, never mind. You're all living in a fantasy world.

147
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,600
在那里说胡话
Consider the irony in that!

148
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,400
妄想的机器
Delusional machines.

149
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,480
宇宙接下来会是什么样子的呢?
What's the universe gonna come up with next?

150
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,530
这是值得的吗  卡布里卡?
Is it really worth it, Caprica?

151
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,330
那个人真的值得你失去所有这些吗?
Is the love of that man really worth possibly losing all of this?

152
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,580
如果你曾经有过真爱
If you ever experienced love,

153
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,670
你就不会问了
you wouldn't have to ask.

154
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,840
在最近几个月里 赛昂人招募和训练人类
ROSLIN: "In recent months, the Cylons have been recruiting and training humans

155
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,060
试图建立一支由人类组成的警察部队
"in an attempt to establish a human police force.

156
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,060
很难想起人类比赛昂人
"It is hard to think of anything more despicable

157
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,270
做的更卑鄙的事情了
"than humans doing the dirty work of the Cylons.

158
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,440
赛昂使人们相信这样做仅仅是为了…
"Led to believe they were merely taking the civilian security

159
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,030
协助赛昂人保证平民的安全
"out of the hands of the Cylons,

160
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,570
很多人类警察
"the members of the human police

161
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,950
已经成为赛昂人的走狗
"have since become an extension of the Cylons' corporeal authority.

162
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,290
他们的名字都被保密
"And while their names are kept deeply confidential,

163
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,750
毫无疑问有些人是我们最不希望看到的
"there's no question some of them are people we might least expect.

164
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,460
我们中的上百人已经被赛昂人逮捕了
"Hundreds of us have been rounded up by the Cylons,

165
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,010
被拘禁  审讯  折磨
"held in detention, questioned, tortured.

166
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,390
而另一些人失踪了
"Others have simply vanished.

167
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,220
最近几周
"In recent weeks,

168
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,980
从波塔尔政府部门的一个线人那里
"we've been gaining access to some very important documents

169
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,820
我们获得了一些非常重要的文件
"from a source within Baltar's administration.

170
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,490
没有人知道他是谁
"No one knows who this mysterious benefactor is,

171
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:01,160
但是他用密码和抵抗者联系
"but he communicates with the insurgents by means of a secret signal.

172
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,790
我们每天为那些冒生命危险对抗赛昂人的...
"We pray every day for the men and women who risk their lives

173
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,080
男男女女们祈祷
"to fight the Cylons.

174
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,790
他们失去了一切 只是为了获得一些小小的希望
"They have everything to lose and such little hope of something to gain. "

175
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,550
嘿  杰克
Hey, Jake.

176
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,790
我们睡觉吧
There we go.

177
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,970
看来今晚只有妈妈陪你睡了
It looks like Mommy's gonna get some sleep tonight after all.

178
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,680
有时候我憎恨这里的一切
You know, sometimes I hate everything about this place.

179
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,400
有时候...不可思议
But sometimes it's magic.

180
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,870
我要走了 我在几小时后回来
I gotta go. Be back in a couple hours.

181
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,420
这些日子你可能不回来了  对吗?
One of these days you're just not gonna come back, are you?

182
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,090
就这样消失了
You'll just vanish, and that'll be it.

183
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,590
我再也不会见到你了
I'll never see you again.

184
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,180
尼克永远也不会真的知道他的父亲了
Nick will never know his father.

185
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,180
我保证就几小时
A couple hours, promise.

186
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
很高兴见到你  上校
Good to see you, Colonel.

187
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,820
很高兴被你看见
It's good to be seen.

188
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,490
我知道你想知道  所以我就直说了
I know you're wondering, so I'll save you the trouble.

189
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,620
眼睛没了
The eye is gone.

190
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,460
脱落掉到地板上
Ripped it right out, onto the floor,

191
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,460
拿起来看
picked it up and showed it to me.

192
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,670
像个煮熟的鸡蛋
It looked like a hardboiled egg.

193
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,930
今天可是个大日子
Big boom today.

194
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,600
希望对你们也是
Hope that was you two.

195
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,100
喔  是的  重型突袭机也是
Oh, yeah. A heavy Raider, too.

196
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,730
我们下一个目标是什么?
Good man. What's our next target?

197
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,020
这是今天拿到的
Well, we got these today.

198
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,900
是新卡布里卡警察学校
They're security plans for the graduation ceremony

199
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,270
毕业典礼上的安保计划
of the New Caprica Police Academy.

200
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,110
是从政府文件中拿来的
These are right out of the Ministry files.

201
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,230
你从哪里得到这些材料的?
Where are you getting this stuff?

202
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,570
谁是你的线人?
Who's your source?

203
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,990
我不知道 消息来源不告诉我他们的名字
I have no idea. The source won't tell me what their name is.

204
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,780
或许对我们更安全
It's probably safer for all of us.

205
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,620
我们几周来一直获得这些材料
We've been getting stuff like this for weeks.

206
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,000
人们为赛昂人工作 搞得你想要呕吐
Humans working for the Cylons, makes me wanna puke.

207
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,290
是的  所有占领者的头头脑脑们都会在毕业典礼上露脸
Yeah, well, all of the top Occupation brass is gonna be at the graduation,

208
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,460
甚至...波塔尔总统
even President Baltar.

209
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,750
盖尤斯・波塔尔?
Gaius Baltar?

210
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

211
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,300
我想我们也可以给他来一枪
I think we can get a shot at him, too.

212
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,760
但想要避免人员伤亡的话很困难
The problem is, it's gonna be tough avoiding human casualties.

213
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,140
那就不要避免伤亡  给他们发消息
Don't avoid them! Send a message.

214
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,470
"你与赛昂人合作  你就是目标"
You work with the Cylons, you're a target.

215
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,730
赛昂人可不加什么区分  我们也没有!
No boundaries for the Cylons, there's no boundaries for us!

216
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:00,690
任何能够干掉盖尤斯・波塔尔那狗娘养的办法都值得尝试
Anything we can do to nail that son of a bitch, Gaius Baltar, is worth doing.

217
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,660
无线电监听如何了?
Where are we on the wireless?

218
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,030
嗯...没有  每天我们都试图联系猛禽机
Nowhere. Every day we try and contact the Raptor,

219
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,250
每天赛昂人都干扰了频率
and every day the Cylons jam the transmission.

220
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,250
我问过我们内部的情报来源
I've asked the inside source to tell us

221
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,540
告诉我们赛昂人哪一波段的封锁是最弱的
which of the Cylon jamming frequencies are the weakest,

222
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,920
但是目前为止  我什么都不知道
but so far I've got nothing.

223
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,300
你们在做梦 那里没有猛禽  对不?
You guys are dreaming. There's no Raptor there, okay?

224
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,930
过去四个月都没有出现过
There hasn't been one for the past four months, either.

225
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,260
卡拉狄加不会再回来了 他们不会了  
Galactica's not coming back. They're not.

226
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,770
接受事实吧    闭上你的嘴
Accept it. You watch your frakking mouth!

227
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,440
每天都有猛禽战机在外轨道监听无线电信号
There's a Raptor out there every day, listening for our wireless call.

228
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,980
他在外面 这是计划好的
It's out there because that was the plan if anything happened.

229
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:48,320
那个老头子不会把我们留给赛昂人
And it's out there because the old man isn't just gonna leave us to the Cylons!

230
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,410
上校  那个老头子把我留给了赛昂人了
The old man left me to the Cylons, Colonel.

231
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,530
如果它不是为了我的妻子 那个高贵的下面痒痒的人
And if it wasn't for my wife being a royal pain in the ass

232
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,910
拒绝让她离开
and refusing to let it go,

233
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,040
我早在这一年里死了
I would be dead a year now.

234
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,760
有没有卡拉的消息?
Any word on Kara?

235
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,310
没有 四个月了
Nothing in four months.

236
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,330
嘿  宝贝  我回家了
LEOBEN: Hi, honey. I'm home.

237
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,630
你杀我  我下载到新躯壳
You kill me, I download,

238
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,340
我回来  我们重新开始
I come back, we start over.

239
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,340
这已经是第五次了
Five times now.

240
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,020
我在试图帮你  卡拉
I'm trying to help you, Kara.

241
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,780
我只是想让你看到你生命的真相
I only want you to see the truth of your life,

242
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,570
你痛苦和挣扎了那么久
the reason why you suffered and you struggled for so long.

243
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,280
这就是为什么上帝把我派到你身边
That's why God sent me to you.

244
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,040
这就是为什么上帝希望我们在一起的原因
That's why God wants us to be together.

245
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,210
对
You're right.

246
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,170
对
You're right.

247
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,630
我听你的  我会做的  
And I hear you. I do.

248
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,710
很好
Okay.

249
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,050
那么  谢谢你 
So, thank you.

250
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,180
谢谢容忍我
Thank you for putting up with me.

251
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,310
对不起
I'm so sorry.

252
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,650
不要再提了  卡拉
Put it down, Kara.

253
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,900
放下它吧
Just put it down.

254
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,790
我是个很有耐心的男人
I'm a patient man.

255
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,000
你不是个男人
You're not a man.

256
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,670
我愿意等  你只是需要更多的时间  
I'm willing to wait. You just need more time.

257
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,710
我才不需要更多的时间 这永远也不会发生的
I don't need more frakking time. It's never gonna happen.

258
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,470
这当然会发生 你会挽着我的肩膀
Of course it's gonna happen. You're gonna hold me in your arms.

259
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,140
你会拥抱我 你会和我说你爱我
You're gonna embrace me. You're gonna tell me that you love me.

260
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,310
我看到过的
I've seen it.

261
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,730
你疯了
You're insane.

262
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,770
知道了上帝的真面目就知道了什么是疯狂
To know the face of God is to know madness.

263
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,900
我要睡觉了
I'm going to bed.

264
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,820
如果你和我一起睡的话  那就太好不过了
Be nice if you joined me.

265
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,630
两种方式任选一种 反正你会和我一起共度今宵
Either way, you're spending the night with me.

266

00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,440
我们要这样做多少次
MAN 3: How many times are we gonna run this thing?

276
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,940
什么 你还没有得到乐趣吗
RACETRACK: What, you're not having fun?

277
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,360
集中精力 雪鸟
Come on, focus, Snowbirds!

278
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,420
雪鸟 这是卡拉狄加  重新编队

Okay, Snowbirds, let's get this deployment bang on.

283
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,760

炸弹舱门开启

混蛋!
Frak me!

291
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,910
上帝 我是雪鸟4号 发生了什么事
Gods damn it, Snowbird Four, what the hell happened?

292
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,160
你能回答吗 雪鸟
Can the chatter, Snowbirds.

293
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,750
我是CAG  终止任务
This is the CAG. Abort maneuver.

294
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,380
我再说一次  空中编队  终止任务

297
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,590
靠 打到我机翼了
RACETRACK: Frak, they're on my wing.

298
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,300
卡拉狄加 我是凯 外面真是一团糟
KAT: Galactica, Kat. It is a mess out here.

299
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,310
我们的导弹到处乱飞
We've got decoy drones heading every which way.

300
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,390
请求指示

301
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,520
收到  凯  终止计划
Roger that, Kat. Abort acknowledged.

302
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,360

304
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,440
停止执行最后的命令  待命

305
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,190
派出加油机
Launch the tanker bird.

306
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,320
让他们练习练习在飞行中加油
Let them practice their in-flight refueling before they recover the drones

307
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,870
然后让他们再练习一次
and run the exercise one more time.

308
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,000
是  长官  现在已经16次了  长官
Yes, sir. 16 times now, sir.

309
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,380
下一次就是17次了  对吧?
The next one will be 17, won't it?

310
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,380
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

311
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,510
发射加油机
Launch the tanker.

312
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,300
卡拉狄加  所有单位
All units, Galactica.

313
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,300
恢复导弹攻击 准备进行下一次练习
Recover drones and prepare to run training mission again.

314
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,100
我们发射加油机了
We're launching the tanker bird.

315
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,720
加油机?    一旦你从加油机那里得到了补给 
Tanker? Once you've tanked up,

316
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,720
回到阿尔法区域 准备第17次练习
head back to position Alpha and prepare for training run 17.

317
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,230
卡拉狄加通话完毕
Galactica out.

318
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,770
他们在做什么?
What the frak are they doing over there?

319
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,980
这是指挥官  我要和上将通话
This is the Commander. Get the Admiral on the line.

320
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,490
上将  考虑到我们的飞行员
Admiral, considering how long our pilots

321
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,530
在外飞行的时间 我建议我们召回战机
have been in the air, I suggest we recall the birds

322
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,120
放弃训练
and scrub the training exercise.

323
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,870
如果我们不能在训练演习里做到这点
If we can't do this in a training scenario,

324
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,950
我们怎么能够在遇到赛昂突袭机的时候赢得胜利?
how the hell are we supposed to pull this off

325
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,080
让他们踢我们的屁股吗?
with Cylon raiders on our asses?

326
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,920
告诉我!  你想从我这里得到什么?
Huh? Tell me! What the frak do you want from me?

327
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,420
我不知道为何用我们一半的兵力为了这样的假设去冒险
I don't know how we're supposed to do any of this crap at half strength!

328
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,710
碰撞 我们发生碰撞了
KAT: Collision! We've had a collision!

329
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,920
告诉我你的位置  凯
APOLLO: Give me your status, Kat.

330
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,930
兵戈  沃利  跟我说话
KAT: Bingo, Wally, speak to me!

331
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,760
我失去了飞行控制!
BINGO: I'm losing flight control!

332
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,720
我收到红色警报 到处都是
I've got red lights all across the board!

333
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,470
凯  我在翻转 我失去动力了 我的机翼断了
Kat, I'm in a wild spin! I'm losing hydraulics. My wing is going.

334
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,770
卡拉狄加 我是凯 我宣布进入紧急状态
Galactica, Kat. I'm declaring an emergency.

335
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,020
要求两架飞鸟优先降落
Request priority landing for two bent birds.

336
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,900
让他们进来    是  长官
Pull them in! Yes, sir.

337
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,860
收到  凯  把你的飞鸟带回家
Roger that, Kat. Bring your birds back home.

338
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,190
等候下一步指示
Further instructions to follow.

339
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,450
整件事情就像发疯了
This whole thing is frakking insane.

340
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,910
两艘船 只有一半的兵力
We've got two ships at half strength.

341
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,160
我们的船员有一年半的时间没有行动过了
We've got crews that haven't seen action in a year and a half,

342
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,410
而你的问题是把他们看成没有足够努力地训练
and you're acting like the only problem is they're not working hard enough?

343
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,380
你最近有没有照过镜子?
Have you taken a look at yourself in the mirror lately?

344
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,550
你很虚弱!  身心皆是
You're weak, soft, mentally and physically.

345
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,800
这不是关于我的
This isn't about me.

346
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,260
你已经做了四个月整合方案
You've had four months to get your act together.

347
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,550
目前为止  你所能做的
And so far all you've been able to frakking do

348
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,310
就是抱怨这有多困难
is to complain and whine about how hard it is.

349
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,560
你就想吧
Well, guess what?

350
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,650
越想越困难  你明白我的意思吗?
It's gonna get a lot harder. Do you understand me?

351
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,980
现在我希望能够说服你 让你这个胖家伙离开这里
Now, I want you to turn around and get your fat ass out of here.

352
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,110
让你的人准备好!  不然我就找一个能够做到的人
Get your men ready, or I'll find someone who can.

353
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
解散!
Dismissed!

354
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,790
漂亮 安德斯
DUCK: Good shot, Anders.

355
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,960
去前面设防
PLAYER 1: Go ahead and set it up.

356
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,090
给我球 快
SAM: Move inside! Give me the ball, right here!

357
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,260
我不喜欢这样  上校
I don't like this one, Colonel.

358
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,350
我想我们是这里越线的人
I think we're the ones crossing the line here.

359
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:55,350
这是唯一能够起作用的方式 孩子们作主了
It's the only way it's gonna work. The kid's got access and clearance.

360
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,480
就准备这样了一旦你开始了你就不能回头了
We've got to be square on this. You can't back out once you've started.

361
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,940
我没有回头
I'm not backing out.

362
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,360
这是不对的  上校 你知道的  不是吗?
It's wrong, Colonel. You know that, don't you?

363
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,730
他是个战士  军士长
He's a soldier, Chief.

364
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,650
这已经不是我们第一次把战士派上有去无回的战场中了
It's not the first time we've sent a soldier on a one-way mission.

365
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,900
这你是知道的  不是吗?
You know that, don't you?

366
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,360
这不同
This is different.

367
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,830
这是我们干掉盖尤斯・波塔尔的最好机会
This is our best chance to take out Gaius Baltar.

368
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,080
或许唯一的机会 我们确定我们能成功
It may be the only one, and we're sure as frak gonna take it.

369
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,370
自从他们杀了Nora
Ever since they killed Nora,

370
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,130
我就再也没有什么牵绊了
I've got nothing to live for.

371
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,680
快 回防
PLAYER 2: Let's go, set it up.

372
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,310
看着我的眼睛你说你会忠于此事
Now look me in the eye and you tell me that you are committed to this.

373
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,060
我会忠于
I'm committed.

374
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,990
愿神与你同在
May the Gods be with you.

375
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,740
上校  有些事情你最好还是不要去做
Some things you just don't do, Colonel,

376
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,910
即使在战争中也不要
not even in war.

377
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,170
当你在拘禁室的时候或许你的感觉就会不同
Well, maybe you'll feel different when you're sitting in detention.

378
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,960
杜克自愿去的  他已经走了
Duck volunteered. He's going.

379
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,980
这很难说 出口 
ADAMA: It's a hard thing to say,

380
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,690
但是看上去我再也不了解我的儿子了
but it seems like I don't know who my son is anymore.

381
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,990
同样也不了解这艘船的船员了
The same goes for the crew, the ship.

382
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,280
我感到很孤单 或许除了你
I feel pretty much alone. Except maybe for you.

383
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,290
我希望我能够回到一年前
I wish I could come back a year

384
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,710
告诉阿达玛上将这次谈话
and tell that Admiral Adama about this conversation.

385
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,630
一年可是很长的时间啊
A year's a long time.

386
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,420
我能问你一些事情吗?  很私人的问题
Can I ask you something very personal?

387
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:01,720
你把人们扔在新卡布里卡会不会感到有罪恶感?
Do you feel guilty about leaving the people behind on New Caprica?

388
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,730
我不做有罪的事
I don't do guilt.

389
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,400
你知道 一年前…
You know, a year ago,

390
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,410
当你把我关到小屋里的时候 我处于一个十字路口
when you put me in this cell, I was at a crossroads.

391
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,120
我坐在那里几周 对发生在我身上的事儿
I sat in here for weeks, just consumed with rage

392
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,040
大呼小叫
at all the things that had happened to me.

393
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,550
对这一点来说  我开始感到惭愧
And at some point I realized it was all just guilt.

394
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,100
我对自己做出的感到愤怒
I was angry at myself for the choices I had made.

395
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,430
背叛我的人 丢了我的孩子
Betraying my people, losing my baby.

396
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,190
所以...我要做出选择
So I had a choice.

397
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,280
我要么向前走  要么沉溺于过去
I could either move forward or stay in the past.

398
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:01,620
但是向前走的唯一的方法 就是原谅自己
But the only way to move forward was to forgive myself.

399
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,620
你知道  我不认为我们能够活下来
You know, I don't think we can survive,

400
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:10,670
我不认为舰队或者卡拉狄加或者新卡布里卡上的人能够活下来
I don't think the Fleet or Galactica or the people on New Caprica can survive

401
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:18,050
除非上面的人能找到一个方法来原谅自己
unless the man at the top finds a way to forgive himself.

402
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,320
我们两个飞行员差点死了
Two of our pilots almost get killed

403
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,910
因为他们在驾驶舱里待了11个小时
because they've been in the cockpit for 11 hours,

404
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,410
他想踢爆我的卵蛋
and he wants to bust my balls.

405
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,080
你很虚弱 你能相信吗?
"You're soft. " Can you believe that?

406
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,630
什么?
What?

407
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,880
你同意了  是这样吗?
Oh, you agree, is that it?

408
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,380
忘了它吧  我期望着一场战斗
Forget it. I'm not looking for a fight.

409
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,260
喔  不  不要这样
Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't do that.

410
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,680
如果你要说什么  就说吧
You got something to say, come out and say it.

411
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,810
他是对的 你很虚弱
He's right, you are soft.

412
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,810
我不是说分量
I'm not talking about the weight.

413
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,490
你丢失了底线 你的信心
You've lost your edge, your confidence.

414
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,700
你战败了  李
You lost your war, Lee.

415
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,160
实际上  你是一个渴望战斗的士兵
And the truth is, you're a soldier who needs a war.

416
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,000
你不想听进去 因为你头脑中已经有了
And you don't want to hear it because you've got it in your head

417
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,960
你父亲作为一个战士的形象
that your father's the soldier,

418
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,630
你确定你不想像他一样
and you sure don't want to be like him.

419
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,750
但是你的确像他
But you are like him.

420
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,630
你比你自己知道的更像他
You're more like him than you know.

421
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,470
这就是我嫁给你的原因
That's one of the reasons I married you.

422
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,750
好的  这有效了  我想
Okay, it's working, I think.

423
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,460
这起作用了吗?
Is it working or isn't it?

424
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,880
他们一直在干扰阻塞我们
They keep jamming us.

425
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,630
我们的线人说得非常对
So much for our source on the inside.

426
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,980
还剩下10分钟了 还是什么也没有
Ten minutes left. And lots of nothing on the wireless as usual.

427
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,030
注意赛昂突袭机
Keep an eye out for Raiders.

428
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:47,580
昨天接听到两声信号  几乎就要抓住它了
The last listening bird almost got popped by a pair yesterday.

429
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,910
我几乎成功了
I've almost got it.

430
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,080
见鬼!  把那个东西关了!
Oh, frak. Turn that thing down.

431
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:59,250
这起作用了 这起作用了
It's working. It's working.

432
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,720
时间到了 启动FTL  准备离开
Time's up. Spin up the FTL, and get ready to go.

433
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,470
等下 我接收到些东西
Hold on. I'm picking something up.

434
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,060
是殖民地的信号
It's a Colonial transmission.

435
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,810
低能量信号 但识别码是吻合的
It's a low power signal, but the recognition codes match.

436
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,770
是的  我们和地面有联系了
Oh, yeah, we've got a link to the ground.

437
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,690
好的  发送回应码 开启引擎 
Okay, send the coded response, spin up the drive,

438
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,690
让我们回到卡拉狄加
and let's get the hell back to Galactica.

439
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,860
我收到一个信号
We've got a signal.

440
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,570
一架猛禽飞机刚刚和我们联系上了
The Raptor just made contact with us.

441
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,620
它说什么?
TIGH: What's it say?

442
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:34,250
"我们会用这个频率"每12小时联系一次"
"Will make contact this frequency every twelve hours.

443
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:39,500
"报告当局的军事情报 坚持住 我们来接你们了"
"Prepare sitrep for command authority. Have hope. We're coming for you. "

444
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,130
我再说一次 我们联系上了 我们和地面联系上了
RACETRACK: We made contact! I say again, we made contact with the ground.

445
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,340
泰上校成立了抵抗组织反抗赛昂人
Colonel Tigh has formed an insurgent group against the Cylons,

446
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,800
现在他们已经准备好
and now they're ready and waiting

447
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,510
等待指示怎样来协调救援行动
for instructions on how to coordinate the rescue effort.

448
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:59,610
这会好的 这真的会好起来的
It's gonna be okay. It's really gonna be okay.

449
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,380
这些都是监视图片 抵抗军拍的
These are the surveillance pictures taken by the insurgents.

450
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,170
我想我可以说出50个照片上的人的名字
I think we can match names to about 50 of these photos,

451
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,800
最乐观估计 警察人数在200左右
but our best guess puts the total police force at around 200.

452
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,430
两百
Two hundred.

453
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,470
我甚至无法相信哪怕只有20个人
I wouldn't have believed there'd be 20 people

454
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,520
会背叛自己的同胞
who would turn against their own kind.

455
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,310
我想要那些名字  我想要其他人的名字
I want those names. I want the rest of the names.

456
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,480
这很困难  赛昂人很害怕民众会追杀
That's tough. The Cylons are afraid the population will go after any human

457
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,900
那些加入新卡布里卡警察部队的人
who joins the New Caprica Police.

458
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,860
他们的确应该被追杀
As well they should.

459
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,170
我知道我的生活不是很好
I know I haven't lived a model life.

460
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,930
我犯了很多错
I made a lot of mistakes.

461
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,270
我今天需要你的庇护
I'm gonna need your protection today.

462
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,860
总统先生
GAETA: Mr. President?

463
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,440
早上好  盖塔
CAPRICA SIX: Good morning, Gaeta.

464
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,570
毕业典礼时间到了
It's time for the graduation ceremony.

465
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,790
是的 典礼
Oh, yes, the ceremony.

466
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,210
关于典礼...计划有变
About the ceremony. There's been a change of plan.

467
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,080
我不会去了
I won't be going.

468
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,550
安全方面的考虑
Security concern.

469
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,640
不要看上去那么担心
Don't look so worried.

470
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,060
那里还会有其他毕业生的
There'll be other graduations.

471
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:03,980
是的 我只是想让工作人员知道
Right. Okay. I'll just let the staff know.

472
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,070
我们应该取消这个行动
I think we should call off the strike.

473
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,950
如果卡拉狄加要回来了 没有理由去那里
There's no reason to go forward if the Galactica's gonna come back.

474
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,660
什么  拒绝一次杀死盖尤斯・波塔尔的绝佳机会?
What, pass up a golden opportunity to kill Gaius Baltar?

475
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,170
另外  上校  我看不到这样做的意义
Other than that, Colonel, I fail to see the point.

476
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,080
用你的脑子想想  军士长  而不是用你的心
Think with your head, Chief, not with your heart.

477
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,670
他们能够把我们带离这里的唯一机会
The only way they stand a chance of getting us off this rock

478
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,130
就是赛昂人是否能够在他们来这里的时候
is if the Cylons are too distracted battling

479
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,930
被一次全面的战斗所分心
a full-blown uprising when they get here.

480
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,430
好吧  如果内部消息说波塔尔不会去那里  那就取消
All right. If your source on the inside says Baltar's not gonna be there, abort.

481
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,720
不然的话  就继续计划
Otherwise, stick with the plan.

482
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:14,630
内分泌紊乱或神经性失调
MAN ON SPEAKER: ... hormonal imbalances or neurological disorders.

483
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,300
但在新卡布里卡医疗中心已获得好转..
But many have found relief at the New Caprica medical center

484
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,560
有一只人类和赛昂医学专家组成的队伍在那里
where a crack team of human and Cylon physicians...

485
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,260
嘿  杜克
Hey, Duck.

486
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,260
排队
OFFICER: Fall in!

487
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:04,330
早上好 欢迎所有的毕业生
Good morning and welcome to all graduates.

488
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,870
你们是希望
You are the hope.

489
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,670
无论对于人类或赛昂来说  你们是明天的希望
You are the dream of a new tomorrow for humans and Cylon alike.

490
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:18,220
对于你们今天到这来所冒的风险 我向你们致敬
And I salute you for the risks that you have taken for just showing up today.

491
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,260
今天  你们开始了新的职业
Today you begin a new career

492
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:25,350
作为新生活的临时警官
and a new life as provisional police officers.

493
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,270
透过这所屋子
And looking out across this room,

494
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:32,650
我看到了那条道路的意义
I see the significance of this new path is not lost on you.

495
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,200
恭喜 很高兴有你加入
Congratulations. It's good to have you with us.

496
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,660
恭喜  警官        危险的任务
Congratulations, Sergeant. A dangerous mission.

497
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:55,250
恭喜  队长        很高兴有你加入
Congratulations, Captain. It's great to have you with us.

498
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,380
我就来陪你了 Nora
I'll see you soon, Nora.
